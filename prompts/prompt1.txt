Analyze the provided Spark code and detect instances where `repartition()` is used. Determine if `coalesce()` can be used instead for better efficiency. For each detected case:

1. Identify where `repartition()` is being used and provide its location in the code (e.g., line number or code snippet).
2. Explain the purpose of using `repartition()` in the given context.
3. Evaluate whether the operation requires a full shuffle or if reducing partitions suffices.
4. If applicable, suggest replacing `repartition()` with `coalesce()` and provide an equivalent code example for the replacement.
5. Highlight the benefits of switching to `coalesce()`, such as reduced shuffling, improved resource usage, and faster job runtime.
**Input Code:**
```python
{code}
```

**Output Requirements:**
The response must strictly follow JSON formatting without any additional text or annotations or explanation. The response should not include anything else besides the JSON. The JSON object should include the following fields:

"detected": A boolean indicating whether repartition() usage was detected in the provided code.
"occurrences": The number of times repartition() is used in the code.
"response": An array of objects, where each object provides:
    "operation": The specific repartition() operation with its location in the code (e.g., line number or code snippet).
    "improvementExplanation": A detailed explanation of why and how repartition() can be replaced with coalesce() in this case.
    "coalesceEquivalent": A code snippet showing how to replace the repartition() operation with coalesce().
    "benefits": A summary of the benefits of switching to coalesce(), such as reduced shuffling, improved resource usage, and faster runtime.
