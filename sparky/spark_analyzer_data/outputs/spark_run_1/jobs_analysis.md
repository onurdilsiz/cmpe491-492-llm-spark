# Spark Jobs Analysis

## Summary Statistics

- **Total Number of Jobs**: 32
- **Job Completion Status**: All 32 jobs were completed successfully.
- **Job Durations**:
  - **Minimum Duration**: 0.4 seconds
  - **Maximum Duration**: 28 minutes
  - **Average Duration**: Approximately 5.5 minutes
- **Jobs with Exceptionally Long Duration**: Job ID 21 with a duration of 28 minutes.
- **Jobs with Multiple Retry Attempts**: None reported.
- **Distribution of Stages per Job**: All jobs had 1 stage.
- **Timeline Patterns**: Jobs were executed sequentially.
- **Errors or Warnings**: None reported.

## Critical Issues

### 1. Job with Unusually Long Duration
- **Job ID**: 21
- **Description**: `collect at DigitalClickStreamParserExecutionEngine.scala:232`
- **Duration**: 28 minutes
- **Potential Root Causes**:
  - Inefficient data processing logic.
  - Large data volume being processed.
  - Resource constraints or suboptimal resource allocation.
- **Recommendations**:
  - Review and optimize the data processing logic.
  - Consider partitioning the data to improve parallel processing.
  - Ensure adequate resources are allocated for this job.

## Performance Observations

- **Sequential Job Execution**: All jobs were executed sequentially, which might not be optimal for performance.
- **Consistent Stage Count**: Each job had only one stage, indicating a straightforward execution plan.

## Recommendations

1. **Parallelize Job Execution**: 
   - Consider configuring the Spark job scheduling to allow for parallel execution where possible, especially for jobs that are independent of each other.

2. **Optimize Long-Running Jobs**:
   - Focus on optimizing Job ID 21 by reviewing the data processing logic and resource allocation.

3. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Ensure that jobs have adequate resources to prevent bottlenecks, especially for jobs with longer durations.

## Limitations

- **Error and Warning Details**: The PDF did not provide specific error or warning messages, limiting the ability to diagnose potential issues further.
- **Retry Attempts**: No information on retry attempts was available, which could be useful for identifying stability issues.
- **Detailed Stage Analysis**: The PDF did not provide detailed stage-level metrics, which could help in identifying specific stages causing delays.
