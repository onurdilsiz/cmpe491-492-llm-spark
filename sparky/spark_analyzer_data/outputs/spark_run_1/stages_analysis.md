## Critical Issues

### 1. Stages with Significant Data Skew
- **Stage ID 23**: Duration of 28 minutes with input size of 64.3 GiB and output size of 61.0 GiB.
  - **Potential Root Causes**: Uneven data distribution leading to some tasks taking significantly longer.
  - **Recommendations**: Investigate data partitioning and consider rebalancing data distribution.

### 2. Stages with Excessive Shuffle Operations
- **Stage ID 88**: High shuffle write size of 662.7 GiB.
  - **Potential Root Causes**: Inefficient data shuffling due to poor partitioning or large data movement.
  - **Recommendations**: Optimize data partitioning and reduce shuffle operations by using techniques like broadcast joins if applicable.

### 3. Stages with Large Data Spills to Disk
- **Stage ID 25**: Input size of 627.4 GiB and output size of 635.6 GiB.
  - **Potential Root Causes**: Insufficient memory leading to data spilling to disk.
  - **Recommendations**: Increase executor memory or optimize data processing to fit within available memory.

## Data Skew Analysis

- **Task Duration Variance**: Not directly calculable from the data provided.
- **Shuffle Read/Write Size Variance**: Not directly calculable from the data provided.
- **Peak-to-Median Ratio for Task Durations**: Not directly calculable from the data provided.

## Shuffle Operation Analysis

- **Stage ID 88**: Notable for high shuffle write size, indicating potential inefficiencies in data movement.

## Recommendations

1. **Data Skew Mitigation**: 
   - Rebalance data distribution across partitions.
   - Use techniques like salting to distribute keys more evenly.

2. **Shuffle Optimization**:
   - Optimize join operations to reduce shuffle size.
   - Consider using broadcast joins for smaller datasets.

3. **Memory Management**:
   - Increase executor memory to reduce data spills.
   - Optimize data processing logic to fit within available memory.

4. **Parallelization Opportunities**:
   - Review stages for potential parallel execution to improve performance.

## Limitations

- **Task Metrics**: Detailed task-level metrics such as task duration, shuffle read/write sizes, executor run time, JVM GC time, serialization/deserialization time, and memory spill were not available in the provided PDF content.
- **Data Skew and Variance Calculations**: Unable to calculate specific variances and peak-to-median ratios due to lack of detailed task-level data.

This analysis is based on the available data from the PDF content. Further insights could be gained with access to more detailed task-level metrics and execution logs.
