# Spark Executors Analysis

## Summary Statistics
- **Total Number of Executors**: 130
  - **Active Executors**: 126
  - **Dead Executors**: 4
- **Executor Host Distribution**: Information not fully available in the provided content.

## Resource Utilization Analysis
- **CPU and Memory Usage**:
  - Executors have 8 cores each.
  - Memory usage per executor is around 14.2 GiB.
  - Peak memory usage varies slightly, with some executors reaching up to 24.4 GiB.
- **Disk Usage**:
  - Disk usage per executor is around 20-28 GiB.
- **Network I/O**:
  - Shuffle read and write operations are consistent across executors, indicating balanced network I/O.

## GC Analysis
- **Garbage Collection (GC) Time**:
  - GC times range from 4.1 to 6.9 minutes.
  - Executors with higher GC times (e.g., Executor 11 with 6.9 minutes) may indicate memory pressure.

## Task Distribution Analysis
- **Task Distribution**:
  - Tasks are evenly distributed across executors, with each handling approximately 95-106 tasks.
  - No active tasks or failed tasks reported, indicating stable task execution.

## Critical Executor Issues
- **Executors with Excessive GC Time**:
  - Executor 11: GC time of 6.9 minutes, which is significant compared to others.
- **Memory Pressure Indicators**:
  - Executor 15: Peak memory usage of 24.4 GiB, which is higher than others.
- **Resource Utilization Imbalances**:
  - Executor 15 shows higher disk usage (28.3 GiB) compared to others.

## Driver Analysis
- **Driver Metrics**:
  - No active tasks or failed tasks.
  - Duration of 1.3 hours with no GC time, indicating no immediate bottleneck.

## Recommendations
1. **Address Memory Pressure**:
   - Investigate Executor 11 for potential memory leaks or inefficient memory usage.
   - Consider increasing memory allocation or optimizing memory usage for Executor 15.
2. **Optimize GC Performance**:
   - Review and optimize the garbage collection strategy for executors with high GC times.
3. **Balance Resource Utilization**:
   - Monitor and adjust resource allocation for Executor 15 to prevent potential bottlenecks.

## Limitations
- **Incomplete Host Distribution**: The PDF content does not provide a complete view of the executor host distribution.
- **Limited Network I/O Details**: Detailed network I/O metrics are not available, limiting the analysis of potential network bottlenecks.
