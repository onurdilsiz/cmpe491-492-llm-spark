To provide a comprehensive analysis of the Apache Spark Stages tab from the PDF content, I would need the actual content of the PDF. Since I don't have access to the PDF content directly, I'll guide you on how to extract and analyze the information based on the instructions provided. Once you have the data, you can follow these steps to create a detailed report.

### Summary Statistics

- **Total Number of Stages**: Count the total number of stages listed in the PDF.
- **Stage Completion Status**: Count how many stages are successful and how many have failed.
- **Stage Durations**: Calculate the minimum, median, and maximum duration for all stages.
- **Number of Tasks per Stage**: List the number of tasks for each stage.

### Task Metrics

For each stage, extract the following metrics:
- **Task Duration**: Calculate the minimum, median, and maximum task duration.
- **Shuffle Read/Write Sizes**: Note the shuffle read and write sizes.
- **Executor Run Time**: Record the executor run time.
- **JVM GC Time**: Note the garbage collection time.
- **Serialization/Deserialization Time**: Record the time spent on serialization and deserialization.
- **Memory Spill**: Note any memory spills to disk or memory.

### Data Skew Analysis

- **Task Duration Variance**: Calculate the variance of task durations within each stage.
- **Shuffle Read/Write Size Variance**: Calculate the variance of shuffle read/write sizes across tasks.
- **Peak-to-Median Ratio**: Calculate the ratio of the maximum task duration to the median task duration for each stage.

### Critical Issues

Identify stages with the following issues:
- **Data Skew**: Stages where the maximum task duration is more than twice the median.
- **Excessive Shuffle Operations**: Stages with high shuffle read/write sizes.
- **High GC Overhead**: Stages where GC time is more than 20% of the execution time.
- **Large Data Spills**: Stages with significant data spills to disk.
- **Serialization Bottlenecks**: Stages with high serialization/deserialization times.
- **Task Imbalance**: Stages with too few or too many tasks.
- **Parallelization Opportunities**: Sequential stages that could be parallelized.

### Recommendations

For each identified issue, provide:
- **Stage ID and Description**: Identify the specific stage and describe the issue.
- **Relevant Metrics**: Present the metrics that highlight the problem.
- **Potential Root Causes**: Suggest possible reasons for the issue.
- **Specific Recommendations**: Offer actionable steps to resolve the issue.

### Limitations

- **Missing Information**: Note any data that was not available or could not be extracted from the PDF.
- **Assumptions**: Mention any assumptions made during the analysis.

Once you have the PDF content, you can extract the necessary data and fill in the sections above to create a detailed Markdown report. If you have specific data from the PDF, feel free to share it, and I can help you analyze it further.
