            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a text file using RDDs, which is less efficient compared to using DataFrames with a serialized format like Parquet. Text files are not optimized for Spark's processing capabilities, lacking features like schema enforcement, compression, and efficient querying. Switching to Parquet can leverage these features, improving performance.",

            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet format provides several benefits: faster read and write operations due to columnar storage, better compression, and reduced storage space. It also supports predicate pushdown, which optimizes query performance by filtering data at the storage level, reducing the amount of data processed."
