      "operation": "pd.DataFrame(result).to_csv(\"rbmWeights.csv\", header=None, index=None)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation writes the result to a CSV file. CSV is a text-based format that is not optimized for performance in terms of read/write speed or storage efficiency. Switching to a binary format like Parquet would improve performance because Parquet is columnar, supports compression, and allows for efficient querying with predicate pushdown.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()\nresult_df = spark.createDataFrame(pd.DataFrame(result).values.tolist())\nresult_df.write.parquet(\"rbmWeights.parquet\")",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet provides faster read/write operations due to its columnar storage, reduces storage space with built-in compression, and enhances query performance with predicate pushdown capabilities."
