            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a text file. Text files are not optimized for performance as they do not support columnar storage or compression. Switching to a format like Parquet or ORC would allow for more efficient storage and retrieval due to their columnar nature and built-in compression.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "df1 = spark.read.parquet(\"hdfs://namenode/user/controller/ncdc-orig/2000-2018.parquet\")",
            "benefits": "Parquet provides efficient data compression and encoding schemes, resulting in reduced storage space and faster read times. It also supports predicate pushdown, which can significantly speed up query execution."

            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation writes data to a CSV file with LZ4 compression. While CSV is a common format, it lacks the efficiency of columnar formats like Parquet or ORC. These formats offer better compression and faster read/write operations.",

            "benefits": "Using Parquet for output will reduce the file size due to better compression and improve read performance. Parquet's columnar storage format allows for efficient data retrieval and supports advanced optimizations like predicate pushdown."
