            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(50) operation is used to increase the number of partitions to 50 before writing the DataFrame to a CSV file. If the current number of partitions is greater than 50, coalesce() can be used instead to reduce the number of partitions without a full shuffle, which is more efficient.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df2.coalesce(50).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/repartition/50\")",
            "benefits": "Using coalesce() instead of repartition() reduces the amount of data shuffling across the cluster, leading to improved resource usage and faster job runtime. This is particularly beneficial when reducing the number of partitions."
