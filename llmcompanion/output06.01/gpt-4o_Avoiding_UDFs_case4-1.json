            "improvementExplanation": "The UDF 'executeRestApi' is used to make HTTP requests and parse the JSON response. This operation involves external I/O and cannot be directly replaced with a built-in Spark SQL function or DataFrame operation. However, if the API call can be made outside of Spark and the data is stored in a file or a database, Spark can read the data using its native DataFrame operations, which would be more efficient.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "import requests\nimport json\n\n# Make the API request outside of Spark\nresponse = requests.get('https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/vehicles/getallmakes?format=json', headers=headers)\n\n# Check if the response is successful\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    data = response.json()\n    # Convert the JSON response to a DataFrame\n    df = spark.createDataFrame(data['Results'])\n    df.show()",
            "benefits": "By avoiding UDFs, we enable Spark's Catalyst optimizer to better optimize the query plan, leading to improved performance. Additionally, it reduces the serialization and deserialization overhead associated with UDFs, as data does not need to be moved between the JVM and Python runtime. This approach also simplifies error handling and debugging."
