      "improvementExplanation": "The map() function is used to split each line of the input RDD into a list of customer attributes. This operation can be performed at the partition level using mapPartitions() to reduce the overhead of function calls for each element. By processing each partition as a whole, we can optimize the transformation, especially if the input data is large.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "parsed_customer_rdd = customer_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda lines: (line.split(\",\") for line in lines))",
      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() reduces the function call overhead by applying the transformation to each partition as a whole rather than to each element individually. This can lead to improved performance, especially for large datasets, by optimizing resource utilization and potentially reducing I/O operations."
