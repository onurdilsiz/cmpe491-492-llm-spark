      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation uses pickle to deserialize data received from a server. While pickle is convenient for Python objects, it is not optimized for performance in distributed systems. Switching to a format like Parquet or ORC is not directly applicable here since these formats are typically used for file storage rather than network communication. However, using a more efficient serialization format like Avro or Protocol Buffers could improve performance.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "Consider using a more efficient serialization format like Avro or Protocol Buffers for network communication. This would involve changing both the server and client-side code to use the new format.",
      "benefits": "Using a more efficient serialization format can reduce the size of the data being transmitted, leading to faster network communication and reduced latency."

      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation uses pickle to serialize data before sending it to a server. While pickle is easy to use, it is not the most efficient in terms of performance and size. Switching to a more efficient serialization format like Avro or Protocol Buffers could improve performance.",
