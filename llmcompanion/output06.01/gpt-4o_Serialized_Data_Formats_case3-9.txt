      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame. CSV is a text-based format that is not optimized for performance. Switching to a binary format like Parquet can improve performance due to its columnar storage, which allows for efficient compression and encoding. Parquet also supports predicate pushdown, which can speed up query execution by filtering data at the storage level.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName('OptimizationExample').getOrCreate()\ndf = spark.read.parquet('/Users/mac/Downloads/predictive.parquet')\n# Convert Spark DataFrame to pandas DataFrame if needed\ndf = df.toPandas()",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet format offers faster read and write operations due to its efficient columnar storage. It also provides better compression, reducing storage space. Additionally, Parquet supports predicate pushdown, which can significantly improve query performance by filtering data at the storage level before loading it into memory."
