      "improvementExplanation": "The map() function is used to split each line of the text file into a list of attributes. This operation can be performed at the partition level using mapPartitions() to reduce the overhead of function calls for each line. By processing each partition as a whole, we can handle multiple lines in a single function call, which is more efficient.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "parsed_employee_rdd = employee_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda lines: (line.split(\",\") for line in lines))",
      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() reduces the function call overhead by processing multiple lines at once, leading to improved performance. It is particularly beneficial when dealing with large datasets, as it optimizes resource utilization and can lead to faster execution times."
    },
    {
      "operation": "department_salary_rdd = parsed_employee_rdd.map(lambda emp: (emp[2], float(emp[3])))",
      "improvementExplanation": "The map() function is used to extract the department and salary from each employee record. This transformation can also be performed at the partition level using mapPartitions() to minimize the overhead of invoking the lambda function for each record.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "department_salary_rdd = parsed_employee_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda emps: ((emp[2], float(emp[3])) for emp in emps))",
      "benefits": "Using mapPartitions() here reduces the number of function calls by processing each partition as a batch. This leads to better performance, especially for large datasets, by optimizing CPU and memory usage and reducing the time spent on function call overhead."
