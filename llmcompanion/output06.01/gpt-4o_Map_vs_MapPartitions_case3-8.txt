      "operation": "rdd.zipWithIndex().map(lambda xi: IndexedRow(xi[1], xi[0]))",
      "improvementExplanation": "The map() function is used to transform each element of the RDD by applying a function that creates an IndexedRow from each element. This transformation can be performed at the partition level using mapPartitions() to reduce the overhead of function calls. By processing each partition as a whole, we can create IndexedRow objects in a batch, which is more efficient.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "rdd.zipWithIndex().mapPartitions(lambda iter: (IndexedRow(xi[1], xi[0]) for xi in iter))",
      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() reduces the function call overhead by processing elements in batches. It optimizes resource utilization and can improve performance, especially for large datasets, by minimizing the number of Python function calls and allowing for more efficient memory usage."
