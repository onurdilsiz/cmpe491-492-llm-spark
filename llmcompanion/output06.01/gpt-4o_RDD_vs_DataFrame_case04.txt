    {
      "rddOperation": "customer_rdd = spark.sparkContext.textFile(\"path/to/customers.txt\")",
      "improvementExplanation": "The textFile method creates an RDD from a text file. This can be replaced with the DataFrame API's read method, which is more efficient and provides better optimization opportunities.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "customer_df = spark.read.option(\"header\", \"false\").csv(\"path/to/customers.txt\").toDF(\"customer_id\", \"name\", \"age\", \"city\")",
      "benefits": "Using DataFrame's read method allows Spark to apply optimizations such as predicate pushdown and column pruning, which can significantly improve performance."
    },
    {
      "rddOperation": "parsed_customer_rdd = customer_rdd.map(lambda line: line.split(\",\"))",
      "improvementExplanation": "The map operation is used to split each line into columns. This can be directly handled by the DataFrame API when reading the CSV file.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "customer_df = spark.read.option(\"header\", \"false\").csv(\"path/to/customers.txt\").toDF(\"customer_id\", \"name\", \"age\", \"city\")",
      "benefits": "By using DataFrame's built-in CSV parsing capabilities, we avoid the overhead of manual parsing and benefit from Spark's internal optimizations for data processing."

      "rddOperation": "adult_customers_rdd = parsed_customer_rdd.filter(lambda cust: int(cust[2]) >= 18)",

      "dataframeEquivalent": "adult_customers_df = customer_df.filter(customer_df.age >= 18)",
      "benefits": "DataFrame filter operations are optimized by Spark's Catalyst optimizer, which can reduce the amount of data shuffled and improve execution speed."
