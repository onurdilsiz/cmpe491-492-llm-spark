            "improvementExplanation": "The get_k_dist function calculates the haversine distance and applies a Gaussian kernel. The haversine distance can be calculated using built-in functions like acos, sin, cos, and radians. The Gaussian kernel can be directly computed using the exp function. This avoids the need for a UDF.",
