    {
      "operation": "lines.map(lambda x: check_prem_typ_desc(x[16]))",
      "improvementExplanation": "The map() function is used to apply the check_prem_typ_desc function to each element of the RDD. Since this operation involves processing each element independently and the function is not I/O-heavy, it can be performed at the partition level using mapPartitions(). This would allow the function to be applied to an entire partition at once, reducing the overhead of function calls.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "results = lines.mapPartitions(lambda partition: (check_prem_typ_desc(x[16]) for x in partition))",
      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() reduces the overhead of function calls by processing entire partitions at once. This can lead to improved performance, especially when dealing with large datasets, as it minimizes the number of Python function calls and can optimize resource utilization."
