            "operation": "cells_counts.map(region_counts7)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The map operation is used to apply the region_counts7 function to each element of the RDD cells_counts. Since region_counts7 processes each cell independently and does not require interaction between elements, it can be applied at the partition level using mapPartitions. This would allow processing multiple cells in a single function call, reducing overhead.",

            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions reduces the function call overhead by processing multiple elements in a single call. It can also optimize I/O operations if the function involves any, leading to improved performance."

            "operation": "cells_counts.map(region_counts3)",
            "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the previous case, the map operation applies the region_counts3 function to each element of the RDD cells_counts. This transformation can be performed at the partition level using mapPartitions, allowing batch processing of cells and reducing the overhead of multiple function calls.",

            "benefits": "Using mapPartitions here reduces the overhead of individual function calls and can lead to better performance by processing multiple elements in a single function call, especially beneficial if the function involves I/O operations."
