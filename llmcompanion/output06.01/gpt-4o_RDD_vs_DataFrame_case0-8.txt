      "rddOperation": "reduceByKey at line: rdd2=rdd.reduceByKey(lambda a,b: a+b)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The reduceByKey operation on RDDs can be replaced with a groupBy and aggregation operation on DataFrames, which can leverage Catalyst optimizer for better performance.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ['word', 'count'])\ndf2 = df.groupBy('word').sum('count')\nfor element in df2.collect():\n    print(element)",
      "benefits": "Switching to DataFrames allows Spark to optimize the query using the Catalyst optimizer, which can result in reduced shuffling and better execution plans. DataFrames also provide a more expressive API and can lead to more concise and readable code. Additionally, DataFrames can take advantage of Tungsten's in-memory computation for better resource usage."
