    {
      "rddOperation": "data.map(lambda line: [float(n) for n in line.split()]).cache()",
      "improvementExplanation": "The map operation is used to parse and convert each line of the text file into a list of floats. This can be more efficiently handled using the DataFrame API by reading the text file into a DataFrame and using selectExpr to split and cast the values.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\nspark = SparkSession.builder.config(conf=conf).getOrCreate()\ndata = spark.read.text(dataset)\nA = data.selectExpr('split(value, \" \") as row')\nA = A.selectExpr('transform(row, x -> cast(x as double)) as row')",
      "benefits": "Using DataFrames allows Spark to apply optimizations such as predicate pushdown and catalyst optimization, which can lead to better performance and reduced execution time."

      "rddOperation": "A.mapPartitions(lambda part: [list(part)]).toLocalIterator()",
