            "improvementExplanation": "The operation `textFile` is used to create an RDD from a text file. This can be replaced with a DataFrame using the `spark.read.text` method, which provides better optimization and performance benefits.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "forms = spark.read.text('hdfs:///user/carrdp/FinanceML/13F/Q12015/links10.txt')\nforms.rdd.repartition(10).foreachPartition(getForm)",
            "benefits": "Using DataFrames allows Spark to apply optimizations such as predicate pushdown and catalyst optimization, which can lead to reduced shuffling and better resource usage. Additionally, DataFrames provide a more expressive API and can be integrated with Spark SQL for more complex queries."
