            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(200) operation is used to increase the number of partitions to 200 before writing the DataFrame to a CSV file. If the current number of partitions is greater than 200, repartition() will perform a full shuffle, which is unnecessary if the goal is to reduce the number of partitions. In this case, coalesce() can be used to reduce the number of partitions without a full shuffle, which is more efficient.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df2.coalesce(200).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/repartition/200\")",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() reduces the amount of data shuffling across the cluster, leading to improved resource usage and faster job runtime. This is particularly beneficial when reducing the number of partitions, as coalesce() avoids the full shuffle that repartition() would perform."
