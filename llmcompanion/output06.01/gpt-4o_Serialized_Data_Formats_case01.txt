    {
      "operation": "sales_rdd = spark.sparkContext.textFile(\"path/to/sales.txt\")",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a text file using RDDs, which is less efficient compared to using DataFrames with optimized formats like Parquet. Text files are not columnar and do not support advanced optimizations such as predicate pushdown or compression, leading to slower read times and increased storage requirements.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "sales_df = spark.read.option(\"header\", \"false\").csv(\"path/to/sales.txt\").toDF(\"sale_id\", \"amount\", \"category\")\nelectronics_sales_df = sales_df.filter(sales_df.category == \"Electronics\")\nelectronics_sales_count = electronics_sales_df.count()\nprint(f\"Number of Electronics sales: {electronics_sales_count}\")",
      "benefits": "Switching to a DataFrame with a columnar format like Parquet would enable faster read operations due to columnar storage, better compression, and support for predicate pushdown, which can significantly reduce the amount of data read from disk."
