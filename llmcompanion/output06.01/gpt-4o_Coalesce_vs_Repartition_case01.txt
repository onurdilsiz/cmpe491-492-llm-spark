      "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() function is used here to increase the number of partitions to 10. However, if the goal is to reduce the number of partitions or if the current number of partitions is already sufficient, coalesce() can be used instead. Coalesce() is more efficient when reducing the number of partitions because it avoids a full shuffle, unlike repartition(), which always triggers a shuffle.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "repartitioned_df = electronics_sales_df.coalesce(10)",
      "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() reduces unnecessary shuffling, leading to improved resource usage and faster job runtime. This is particularly beneficial when the number of partitions is being reduced or when the current partitioning is adequate for the subsequent operations."
