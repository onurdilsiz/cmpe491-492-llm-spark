      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a CSV file. CSV is a text-based format that is not optimized for performance in distributed computing environments. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet can improve performance due to its efficient storage, compression, and support for predicate pushdown, which can significantly speed up query execution.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "df_pyspark = spark.read.parquet(\"test2.parquet\")",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet provides faster read and write operations due to its columnar storage format. It also offers better compression, reducing storage space and I/O operations. Additionally, Parquet supports predicate pushdown, which can optimize query performance by filtering data at the storage level."
