            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() function is used here to increase or decrease the number of partitions to L. If the intention is to reduce the number of partitions, coalesce() can be used instead, as it avoids a full shuffle by combining partitions. This is more efficient when reducing the number of partitions.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "rawData = sc.textFile(data_path).coalesce(numPartitions=L)",
            "benefits": "Using coalesce() instead of repartition() reduces the amount of data shuffling across the cluster, leading to improved resource usage and faster job runtime, especially when the number of partitions is being reduced."
