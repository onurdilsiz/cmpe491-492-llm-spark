    {
      "operation": "transactions_rdd = spark.sparkContext.textFile(\"path/to/transactions.txt\")",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a text file using RDDs, which is less efficient compared to using DataFrames with optimized formats like Parquet. Parquet is a columnar storage format that provides efficient data compression and encoding schemes, resulting in better performance for read operations.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "transactions_df = spark.read.format(\"parquet\").load(\"path/to/transactions.parquet\")",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet would allow for faster read operations due to its columnar storage, better compression, and support for predicate pushdown, which can significantly improve query performance."

    {
      "operation": "repartitioned_df.write.format(\"csv\").option(\"header\", \"true\").save(\"path/to/electronics_transactions_output.csv\")",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation writes data to a CSV file, which is not optimized for performance. CSV is a row-based format and lacks efficient compression and query optimization features. Using Parquet would improve write performance and reduce storage space.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "repartitioned_df.write.format(\"parquet\").save(\"path/to/electronics_transactions_output.parquet\")",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet would result in faster write operations, reduced storage requirements due to better compression, and improved query performance through features like predicate pushdown and column pruning."
