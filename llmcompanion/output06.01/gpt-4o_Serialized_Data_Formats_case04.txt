    {
      "operation": "Read text file using RDD at line: customer_rdd = spark.sparkContext.textFile(\"path/to/customers.txt\")",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a text file using RDDs, which is less efficient compared to using DataFrames with optimized formats like Parquet. Text files are not columnar and do not support advanced optimizations such as predicate pushdown and compression, which can lead to slower read times and increased storage usage.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "customer_df = spark.read.option(\"header\", \"false\").csv(\"path/to/customers.txt\").toDF(\"customer_id\", \"name\", \"age\", \"city\")\nadult_customers_df = customer_df.filter(customer_df.age >= 18)",
      "benefits": "Switching to a DataFrame with a columnar format like Parquet would allow for faster read and write operations due to its efficient storage and compression. It also supports predicate pushdown, which can significantly speed up query execution by filtering data at the storage level."
