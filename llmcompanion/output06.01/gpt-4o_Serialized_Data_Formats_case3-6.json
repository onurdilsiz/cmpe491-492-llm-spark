            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a CSV file, which is a text-based format. CSV files are not optimized for performance in terms of read/write speed and do not support advanced features like predicate pushdown or columnar storage. Switching to a format like Parquet or ORC, which are columnar storage formats, can significantly improve performance. These formats support efficient compression and are optimized for query performance, especially for analytical workloads.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "customerDF = spark.read.parquet(\"retailstore.parquet\")",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet provides several benefits: faster read and write operations due to columnar storage, better compression leading to reduced storage space, and improved query performance through predicate pushdown and other optimizations. This is particularly beneficial for large datasets and complex queries."
