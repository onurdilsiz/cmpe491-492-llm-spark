      "operation": "ratings = data.map(lambda l: l.split()).map(lambda l: (int(l[0]), (int(l[1]), float(l[2]))))",
      "improvementExplanation": "The map() operation is used to split each line of the input data and transform it into a tuple of user ID and a tuple of movie ID and rating. This transformation can be performed at the partition level using mapPartitions() to reduce the overhead of function calls for each element.",

      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() reduces the function call overhead by processing each partition as a whole, which can lead to improved performance, especially for large datasets."
    },
    {
      "operation": "moviePairSimilarities = moviePairRatings.mapValues(computeCosineSimilarity).cache()",
      "improvementExplanation": "The mapValues() operation applies computeCosineSimilarity to each value in the RDD. This can be replaced with mapPartitions() to process all values in a partition together, which is beneficial if computeCosineSimilarity involves significant computation.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "moviePairSimilarities = moviePairRatings.mapPartitions(lambda partition: ((key, computeCosineSimilarity(values)) for key, values in partition)).cache()",
      "benefits": "Using mapPartitions() allows for batch processing of values, reducing the overhead of repeatedly calling computeCosineSimilarity and potentially improving performance by leveraging partition-level optimizations."
