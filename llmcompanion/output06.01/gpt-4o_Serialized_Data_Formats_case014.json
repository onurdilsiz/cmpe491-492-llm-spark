            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a text file using RDDs, which is less efficient compared to using DataFrames with optimized formats like Parquet. Text files are not columnar and do not support advanced optimizations such as predicate pushdown and compression, leading to slower read times and higher storage requirements.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "transactions_df = spark.read.option(\"header\", \"false\").csv(\"path/to/transactions.txt\").toDF([\"transaction_id\", \"customer_id\", \"amount\", \"category\"])\nelectronics_transactions_df = transactions_df.filter(transactions_df[\"category\"] == \"Electronics\")",
            "benefits": "Switching to a DataFrame read operation with Parquet format would allow for faster reads due to columnar storage, better compression, and support for predicate pushdown, which can significantly improve query performance."
