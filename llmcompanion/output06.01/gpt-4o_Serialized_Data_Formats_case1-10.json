            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads a text file from HDFS. Text files are not optimized for performance as they do not support compression or efficient querying. Switching to a format like Parquet would allow for better compression and faster read times due to its columnar storage format.",

            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation writes files to HDFS using a subprocess call, which is inefficient and does not leverage Spark's distributed capabilities. Writing directly using Spark's DataFrame API in a format like Parquet would be more efficient.",
