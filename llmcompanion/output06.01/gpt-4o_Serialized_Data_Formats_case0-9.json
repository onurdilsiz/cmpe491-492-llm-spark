            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads a text file using Spark's textFile method. Text files are not optimized for performance as they do not support columnar storage, compression, or efficient querying. Switching to a format like Parquet or ORC would allow for better performance due to their columnar storage, built-in compression, and support for predicate pushdown.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "df = spark.read.text(\"/apps/sparkbyexamples/src/pyspark-examples/data.txt\")\ndf.write.parquet(\"/apps/sparkbyexamples/src/pyspark-examples/data.parquet\")\nrdd = spark.read.parquet(\"/apps/sparkbyexamples/src/pyspark-examples/data.parquet\").rdd",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet format would provide faster read and write operations due to its columnar storage and efficient compression. It also supports predicate pushdown, which can significantly speed up query execution by filtering data early in the processing pipeline."
