            "improvementExplanation": "The map() function is used to apply a 10% discount to each sale amount. This operation is performed element-wise, which can be inefficient due to the overhead of invoking the lambda function for each element. By using mapPartitions(), we can process each partition as a whole, reducing the function call overhead and potentially optimizing I/O operations if the data processing involves external resources.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "discounted_sales_rdd = sales_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda rows: ((row['sale_id'], row['category'], row['amount'] * 0.9) for row in rows))",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() reduces the function call overhead by processing data in batches at the partition level. This can lead to improved performance, especially for I/O-heavy operations, as it allows for more efficient resource utilization and potentially fewer I/O operations."
