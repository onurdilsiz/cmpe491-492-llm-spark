            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() function is used here to change the number of partitions to 24 before performing a random split. Since the goal is to reduce the number of partitions, coalesce() can be used instead to avoid a full shuffle, which is more efficient when reducing the number of partitions.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "train_repartition_df, val_repartition_df, test_repartition_df = (airbnb_df.coalesce(24).randomSplit([.7, .15, .15], seed=42))",
            "benefits": "Using coalesce() instead of repartition() reduces the amount of data shuffling across the cluster, leading to improved resource usage and faster job runtime. This is particularly beneficial when the number of partitions is being reduced, as coalesce() minimizes the data movement required."
