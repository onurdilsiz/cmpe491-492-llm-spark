            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() function is used to increase the number of partitions to 10, which causes a full shuffle of the data. In this context, if the goal is to reduce the number of partitions or if the current number of partitions is sufficient, coalesce() can be used instead to avoid a full shuffle. Since the code does not specify a need for increasing partitions, coalesce() is more efficient.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "repartitioned_df = sales_df.coalesce(10)",
            "benefits": "Using coalesce() instead of repartition() reduces the amount of data shuffling across the cluster, leading to improved resource usage and faster job runtime. This is particularly beneficial when reducing the number of partitions or when the current partitioning is adequate."
