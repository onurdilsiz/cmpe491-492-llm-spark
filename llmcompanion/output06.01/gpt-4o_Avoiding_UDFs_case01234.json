            "improvementExplanation": "The UDF 'multiply_by_two' is used to multiply a column value by 2. This can be replaced with Spark's built-in arithmetic operations, which are more efficient and allow Spark to optimize the execution plan.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "result_with_builtin = df.withColumn(\"doubled\", col(\"numbers\") * 2)",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with a built-in function allows Spark to apply Catalyst optimizations, which can improve query performance. It also reduces serialization overhead and leverages Spark's optimized execution engine for arithmetic operations."
