    {
      "operation": "Read from Kinesis Stream using JSON format at line: dataframe_KinesisStream_node1 = glueContext.create_data_frame.from_options(...)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a Kinesis stream using JSON format. JSON is a text-based format that is not optimized for performance. Switching to a binary format like Parquet or ORC is not directly applicable here since Kinesis streams typically provide data in JSON format. However, once the data is read, it can be converted to a more efficient format for further processing.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "No direct replacement for reading from Kinesis in JSON format, but consider converting to Parquet after reading for further processing.",
      "benefits": "Converting to Parquet after reading can improve performance for subsequent operations by reducing data size and enabling efficient columnar storage."
    },
    {
      "operation": "Write to S3 using Parquet format at line: S3bucket_node3 = glueContext.write_dynamic_frame.from_options(...)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation writes data to S3 using the Parquet format with GZIP compression. Parquet is already an optimized format for storage and querying, providing benefits like columnar storage, efficient compression, and support for predicate pushdown.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "The current operation is already optimized using Parquet format with GZIP compression.",
      "benefits": "Using Parquet format provides faster reads/writes, better compression, and improved query performance through predicate pushdown."
