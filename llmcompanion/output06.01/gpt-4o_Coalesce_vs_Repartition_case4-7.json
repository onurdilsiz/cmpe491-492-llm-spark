            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(1) operation is used to reduce the number of partitions to 1, which triggers a full shuffle of the data across the cluster. Since the goal is to reduce the number of partitions, coalesce(1) can be used instead to avoid a full shuffle, as it is more efficient for reducing the number of partitions.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "azureAuditLog_df_dynf = DynamicFrame.fromDF(azureAuditLog_df.coalesce(1), glueContext, \"dynamic_frame\")",
            "benefits": "Using coalesce() instead of repartition() reduces the amount of data shuffling across the cluster, leading to improved resource usage and faster job runtime. This is particularly beneficial when reducing the number of partitions, as coalesce() minimizes the overhead associated with data movement."
