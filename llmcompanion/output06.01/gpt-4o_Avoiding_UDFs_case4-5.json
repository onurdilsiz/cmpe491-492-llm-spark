            "improvementExplanation": "The UDF 'synthetic_page_skeleton_and_paragraphs_udf' is used to process a binary column containing serialized page objects, applying NLP processing to extract and link entities. This operation involves complex logic that cannot be directly replaced with a built-in Spark SQL function or DataFrame operation. However, if the logic can be broken down into simpler operations that can be expressed using Spark's built-in functions, it would be beneficial. For instance, if the entity extraction and linking can be done using a pre-trained model that outputs results in a structured format, it might be possible to use Spark's native functions to manipulate these results.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "Currently, there is no direct alternative equivalent using built-in functions due to the complexity of the operation. However, consider using Spark MLlib or integrating with a library that can perform the NLP tasks outside of a UDF context, then use DataFrame operations to handle the results.",
            "benefits": "Avoiding UDFs can significantly improve performance by allowing Spark to optimize the query plan using Catalyst. It reduces serialization overhead and leverages Spark's built-in functions, which are optimized for distributed processing. This can lead to better resource utilization and faster execution times."
