      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads a JSON file into memory using Python's built-in JSON library. This approach is not optimized for large-scale data processing as it loads the entire file into memory, which can be inefficient and slow. Switching to a format like Parquet or ORC would allow for more efficient data processing, as these formats are columnar and support predicate pushdown, which can significantly reduce the amount of data read.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "df = spark.read.json('s3a://path/to/links.json')",
      "benefits": "Using Spark's built-in JSON reader allows for distributed reading of the file, which can handle larger datasets more efficiently. Additionally, if the data were stored in Parquet or ORC, it would benefit from columnar storage, compression, and faster read times due to predicate pushdown."

    {
      "operation": "Write DataFrame to Parquet file at line: df_transformed.write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(output_path)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation writes the DataFrame to a Parquet file, which is already an optimized format. Parquet is a columnar storage file format that provides efficient data compression and encoding schemes, resulting in improved performance.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "No change needed, as Parquet is already an optimized format.",
      "benefits": "Parquet provides faster read and write operations due to its columnar storage, supports efficient compression, and allows for query optimization through predicate pushdown, which reduces the amount of data read."
