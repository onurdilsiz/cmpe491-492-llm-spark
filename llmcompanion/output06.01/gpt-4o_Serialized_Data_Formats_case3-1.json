            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a CSV file. CSV is a text-based format that is not optimized for performance in distributed computing environments. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC can improve performance due to better compression, faster read times, and support for predicate pushdown, which can reduce the amount of data read.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "df = spark.read.parquet(conf[\"filepaths\"])",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet will result in faster read operations due to its columnar storage, better compression, and support for predicate pushdown, which can significantly reduce I/O operations by only reading necessary data."

            "operation": "Write model output at line: best_pipeline.save(conf[\"model_output_path\"])",
            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation saves the model pipeline to a specified path. While this operation does not directly involve data format conversion, ensuring that the data used in the pipeline is stored in an optimized format like Parquet can improve the overall performance of the model training and evaluation process.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "Ensure that any intermediate data used in the pipeline is stored in Parquet format for optimal performance.",
            "benefits": "Using Parquet for intermediate data storage can lead to faster data access and reduced storage costs due to better compression, which indirectly benefits the model training and evaluation process."
