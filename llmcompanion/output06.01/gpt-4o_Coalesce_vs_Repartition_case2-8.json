If the current number of partitions is greater than self.num_workers, coalesce() can be used instead to reduce the number of partitions without a full shuffle, which is more efficient.",

If the current number of partitions is greater than self.num_workers, coalesce() can be used to achieve the same result more efficiently by avoiding a full shuffle.",
