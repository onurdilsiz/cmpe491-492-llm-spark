            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a CSV file, which is a plain text format. CSV is not optimized for performance as it lacks support for efficient compression and does not support schema evolution. Switching to a format like Parquet would improve performance due to its columnar storage, which allows for better compression and faster read times, especially for analytical queries.",

            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation writes data to a text file, which is not efficient for large datasets due to lack of compression and schema information. Writing to a Parquet file would be more efficient as it supports compression and stores schema information, making it more suitable for large-scale data processing.",
