      "operation": "transactions_with_message_df = repartitioned_df.withColumn(\"transaction_message\", message_udf(repartitioned_df[\"category\"], repartitioned_df[\"amount\"]))",
      "improvementExplanation": "The UDF 'generate_message' is used to create a custom message for each transaction by concatenating the category and amount. This can be replaced with Spark's built-in 'concat' and 'lit' functions to achieve the same result without using a UDF.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "from pyspark.sql.functions import concat, lit\n\ntransactions_with_message_df = repartitioned_df.withColumn(\n    \"transaction_message\",\n    concat(lit(\"Category: \"), repartitioned_df[\"category\"], lit(\", Amount: $\"), repartitioned_df[\"amount\"])\n)",
      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with built-in functions allows Spark to leverage Catalyst optimizations, which can improve query execution plans. It also reduces serialization overhead and can lead to better performance by avoiding the need to execute Python code for each row."
