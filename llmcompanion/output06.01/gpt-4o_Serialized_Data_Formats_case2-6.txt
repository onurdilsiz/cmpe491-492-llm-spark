    {
      "operation": "HBase read operation using newAPIHadoopRDD (line: hbase_rdd = sc.newAPIHadoopRDD(...))",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from HBase using the HBase input format. While HBase is suitable for real-time read/write operations, for analytical workloads, using a columnar storage format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve performance due to better compression and efficient columnar storage.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "hbase_rdd = spark.read.format('parquet').load('hdfs://path/to/parquet')",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet would allow for faster read operations due to its columnar storage, better compression, and support for predicate pushdown, which can reduce the amount of data read from disk."
    },
    {
      "operation": "HBase write operation using saveAsNewAPIHadoopDataset (line: save_record function)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation writes data back to HBase. While HBase is optimized for random read/write access, for batch processing and analytics, writing to a format like Parquet or ORC can be more efficient.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "result.write.format('parquet').save('hdfs://path/to/output')",
      "benefits": "Writing to Parquet would provide better compression and faster write times for large datasets, as well as improved compatibility with other big data tools for downstream processing."

    {
      "operation": "HBase write operation using saveAsNewAPIHadoopDataset (line: save_message_table function)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the save_record function, this operation writes data to HBase. For analytical workloads, writing to a format like Parquet or ORC can be more efficient.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "flags_rdd.write.format('parquet').save('hdfs://path/to/message_table_output')",
      "benefits": "Using Parquet for output would allow for better compression, faster writes, and improved query performance due to its columnar format and support for predicate pushdown."
