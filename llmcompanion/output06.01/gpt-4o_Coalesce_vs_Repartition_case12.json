            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() is used to increase the number of partitions to 10. However, if the goal is to reduce the number of partitions or maintain the current number, coalesce() is more efficient as it avoids a full shuffle. In this context, if the intention was to reduce partitions or if the current partitioning is sufficient, coalesce() should be used.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "repartitioned_df = sales_df.coalesce(10)",
            "benefits": "Using coalesce() reduces the amount of data shuffling across the cluster, leading to improved performance, better resource utilization, and faster job execution time."
