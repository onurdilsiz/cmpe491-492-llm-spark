      "operation": "Read text file at line: spam_rdd = sc.textFile(file_path_spam)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a text file, which is not optimized for performance. Text files are not compressed and do not support efficient querying. Switching to a format like Parquet would allow for better compression and faster read times due to columnar storage and predicate pushdown.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "spam_rdd = spark.read.parquet('spam.parquet')",

    {
      "operation": "Read text file at line: non_spam_rdd = sc.textFile(file_path_non_spam)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the spam data, the non-spam data is being read from a text file. This format is not efficient for large-scale data processing. Using Parquet would improve performance by reducing I/O operations and storage space due to its efficient compression and columnar storage.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "non_spam_rdd = spark.read.parquet('Ham.parquet')",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet would result in faster data access, reduced storage requirements, and improved query performance through features like predicate pushdown."
