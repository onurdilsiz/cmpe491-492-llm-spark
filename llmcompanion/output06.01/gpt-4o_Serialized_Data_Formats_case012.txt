      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a text file using RDDs. Text files are not optimized for performance as they lack schema information and require additional parsing. Switching to a DataFrame and using a serialized format like Parquet would improve performance by providing efficient storage, compression, and faster read times due to columnar storage.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "transaction_df = spark.read.option(\"header\", \"false\").csv(\"path/to/transactions.txt\").toDF(\"transaction_id\", \"amount\", \"currency\")\ntransaction_df.write.parquet(\"path/to/transactions.parquet\")\ntransaction_df = spark.read.parquet(\"path/to/transactions.parquet\")",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet provides faster read and write operations due to its columnar storage format. It also supports compression, reducing storage space, and enables query optimization through predicate pushdown, which can significantly speed up query execution."
