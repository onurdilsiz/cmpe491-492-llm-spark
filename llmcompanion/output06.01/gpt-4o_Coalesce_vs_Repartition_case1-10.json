            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(10) is used to increase the number of partitions to 10. If the original number of partitions is greater than 10, coalesce() can be used to reduce the number of partitions without a full shuffle, which is more efficient. However, if the original number of partitions is less than 10, repartition() is necessary to increase the partitions, and coalesce() cannot be used.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "forms = spark.textFile('hdfs:///user/carrdp/FinanceML/13F/Q12015/links10.txt').coalesce(10)",
            "benefits": "Using coalesce() instead of repartition() reduces the amount of data shuffling across the cluster, leading to improved resource usage and faster job runtime when reducing the number of partitions."
