      "rddOperation": "map(lambda row: (row['sale_id'], row['category'], row['amount'] * 0.9))",
      "improvementExplanation": "The map operation is applied to each element of the RDD to calculate a 10% discount. This can be inefficient due to the lack of optimization opportunities that DataFrames provide, such as Catalyst optimization and Tungsten execution engine.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "discounted_sales_df = repartitioned_df.withColumn('discounted_amount', repartitioned_df['amount'] * 0.9).select('sale_id', 'category', 'discounted_amount')",
      "benefits": "Switching to DataFrame operations allows Spark to optimize the query execution plan using Catalyst, reducing unnecessary shuffling and improving execution speed. It also leverages the Tungsten execution engine for better memory management and CPU efficiency."
