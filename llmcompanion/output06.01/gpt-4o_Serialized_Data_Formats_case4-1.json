            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation involves creating a DataFrame from an API response and displaying it directly. While this does not involve reading from or writing to a file, if the data were to be persisted for further analysis, using a format like Parquet would be beneficial. Parquet is a columnar storage file format that provides efficient data compression and encoding schemes, resulting in improved performance for read-heavy operations.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "request_df.select(explode(col(\"execute.Results\")).alias(\"results\"))\n    .select(col(\"results.Make_ID\"), col(\"results.Make_Name\"))\n    .write.parquet(\"/path/to/output.parquet\")",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet would allow for faster read and write operations due to its columnar storage format. It also supports efficient compression and encoding, reducing storage space. Additionally, Parquet enables predicate pushdown, which can significantly speed up query performance by filtering data at the storage level."
