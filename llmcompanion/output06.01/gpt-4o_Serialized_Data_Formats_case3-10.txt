      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a CSV file using pandas. CSV is a text-based format that is not optimized for performance in distributed computing environments like Spark. Switching to a format like Parquet or ORC, which are columnar storage formats, can significantly improve performance. These formats support efficient compression and encoding schemes, which reduce storage space and improve I/O performance. They also enable predicate pushdown and other query optimizations, which can speed up data processing tasks.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "df = spark.read.parquet('airport-data.parquet')",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet provides faster read and write operations due to its columnar storage format. It also offers better compression, reducing storage requirements. Additionally, Parquet supports predicate pushdown, which can optimize query performance by filtering data at the storage level, reducing the amount of data transferred and processed."
