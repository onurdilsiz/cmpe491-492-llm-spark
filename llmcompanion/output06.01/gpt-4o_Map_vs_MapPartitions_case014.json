            "improvementExplanation": "The map() function is used to split each line of the text file into a list of transaction attributes. This operation can be performed at the partition level using mapPartitions() to reduce the overhead of function calls for each line. By processing each partition as a whole, we can optimize the transformation, especially if the input data is large.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "parsed_transactions_rdd = transactions_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda lines: (line.split(\",\") for line in lines))",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() reduces the function call overhead by processing multiple lines at once, which is more efficient for large datasets. It also allows for better resource utilization and can optimize I/O operations if the transformation involves reading or writing data."
