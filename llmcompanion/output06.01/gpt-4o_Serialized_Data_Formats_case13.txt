      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation writes the DataFrame to a CSV file. CSV is a text-based format that is not optimized for performance. It lacks features like compression, efficient storage, and query optimization. Switching to a format like Parquet would improve performance due to its columnar storage, built-in compression, and support for predicate pushdown, which can significantly speed up read operations.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "electronics_df.write.format(\"parquet\").save(\"path/to/electronics_sales_output.parquet\")",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet provides faster read and write operations due to its columnar storage format. It also offers better compression, reducing storage space. Additionally, Parquet supports predicate pushdown, which can optimize query performance by filtering data at the storage level."
