            "improvementExplanation": "The map() function is used to split each line of the log file into a list of elements. This operation can be performed at the partition level using mapPartitions() to reduce the overhead of function calls for each line. By processing each partition as a whole, we can optimize the transformation.",

            "improvementExplanation": "The map() function extracts the timestamp from each log entry. This operation can be batched at the partition level using mapPartitions() to minimize the overhead of processing each element individually.",
