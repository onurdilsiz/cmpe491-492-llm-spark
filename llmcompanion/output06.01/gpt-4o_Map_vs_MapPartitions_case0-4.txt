      "improvementExplanation": "The map() function is used to transform each element of the RDD by converting the state code to the full state name using a broadcast variable. This operation can be performed at the partition level using mapPartitions() to reduce the overhead of function calls for each element. By using mapPartitions(), the state_convert function can be applied to all elements in a partition at once, which is more efficient for I/O-heavy operations like accessing a broadcast variable.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "result = rdd.mapPartitions(lambda iter: [(x[0], x[1], x[2], state_convert(x[3])) for x in iter]).collect()",
      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() reduces the function call overhead by processing elements in batches at the partition level. This leads to optimized I/O operations, as the broadcast variable is accessed fewer times, and improves performance by utilizing resources more efficiently."
