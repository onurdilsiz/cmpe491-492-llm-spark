      "operation": "read text file at df1 = spark.read.text(\"hdfs://namenode/user/controller/ncdc-orig/2000-2018.txt\")",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads a text file, which is not optimized for structured data processing. Switching to a format like Parquet or ORC would allow for more efficient storage and retrieval, as these formats are columnar and support compression and predicate pushdown.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "df1 = spark.read.parquet(\"hdfs://namenode/user/controller/ncdc-orig/2000-2018.parquet\")",
      "benefits": "Using Parquet would result in faster read times due to its columnar storage, better compression, and support for predicate pushdown, which can significantly speed up query execution."

      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation writes data in CSV format, which is not efficient for large-scale data processing. Switching to Parquet or ORC would improve write performance and reduce storage space due to better compression and columnar storage.",

      "benefits": "Writing in Parquet format would provide faster write times, reduced storage requirements due to better compression, and improved query performance through columnar storage and predicate pushdown."
