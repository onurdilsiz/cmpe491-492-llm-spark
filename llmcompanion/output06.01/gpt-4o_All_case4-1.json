            "operation": "udf_executeRestApi = udf(executeRestApi, schema)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The UDF 'executeRestApi' is used to make HTTP requests and parse JSON responses. This can be replaced with native DataFrame operations if the data can be pre-fetched and stored in a structured format like Parquet, or if the API call can be handled outside of Spark.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "Instead of using a UDF, consider pre-fetching the data using a separate script and storing it in a distributed file system in a format like Parquet. Then, load the data using Spark's DataFrame API:\n\n```python\n# Assuming data is stored in Parquet format\nrequest_df = spark.read.parquet('path_to_pre_fetched_data')\n```",
            "benefits": "Avoiding UDFs allows Spark to optimize the query execution plan using Catalyst, reduces serialization overhead, and improves performance by leveraging built-in functions and operations."
