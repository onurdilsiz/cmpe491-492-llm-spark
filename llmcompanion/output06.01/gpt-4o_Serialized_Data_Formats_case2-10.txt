      "operation": "Read CSV format using sc.textFile(input_file, m)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a CSV file using sc.textFile. CSV is a text-based format that is not optimized for performance. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet can improve performance due to its efficient storage, compression, and support for predicate pushdown.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "user_basket = spark.read.parquet(input_file).rdd.map(lambda row: (row[0], row[1]))",
      "benefits": "Parquet provides faster read times due to its columnar storage, better compression, and support for predicate pushdown, which can significantly speed up query execution."

      "operation": "Write output to CSV format using open(output_file, 'w+')",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation writes data to a CSV file using Python's open function. Writing to a CSV file is not optimized for performance. Using a format like Parquet can reduce file size and improve write performance.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "output_df = spark.createDataFrame(candidate_collection).write.parquet(output_file)",
      "benefits": "Writing to Parquet format results in smaller file sizes due to better compression and faster write times. It also allows for efficient querying and data retrieval in subsequent operations."
