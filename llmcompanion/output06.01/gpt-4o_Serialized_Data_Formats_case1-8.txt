      "improvementExplanation": "The current code reads data using the Delta format. While Delta is optimized for ACID transactions and is beneficial for data lakes, if the use case is primarily for analytical queries without the need for ACID compliance, switching to Parquet could improve read performance due to its columnar storage and efficient compression. However, if the dataset is frequently updated or requires versioning, Delta might still be the better choice.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "airbnb_df = spark.read.format(\"parquet\").load(f\"{absolute_dir_path}/imputed_results\")",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet can provide faster read operations due to its columnar storage, which is optimized for analytical queries. It also offers efficient compression and supports predicate pushdown, which can further enhance query performance."
