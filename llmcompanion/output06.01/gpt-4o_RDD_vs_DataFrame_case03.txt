    {
      "rddOperation": "employee_rdd.map(lambda line: line.split(\",\"))",
      "improvementExplanation": "The map operation is used to parse each line of the text file into a structured format. This can be more efficiently handled using the DataFrame API by directly reading the text file into a DataFrame with schema inference.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "employee_df = spark.read.option(\"header\", \"false\").option(\"inferSchema\", \"true\").csv(\"path/to/employees.txt\").toDF(\"employee_id\", \"name\", \"department\", \"salary\")",
      "benefits": "Using DataFrame allows Spark to apply optimizations such as predicate pushdown and catalyst optimization, which can lead to better performance and reduced execution time."
    },
    {
      "rddOperation": "parsed_employee_rdd.map(lambda emp: (emp[2], float(emp[3])))",
      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation extracts the department and salary from the parsed RDD. With DataFrames, this can be achieved using select and cast operations, which are optimized for performance.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "department_salary_df = employee_df.select(employee_df[\"department\"], employee_df[\"salary\"].cast(\"float\"))",
      "benefits": "DataFrames provide a more expressive and optimized way to perform columnar operations, reducing the need for explicit type conversions and allowing Spark to optimize the execution plan."
