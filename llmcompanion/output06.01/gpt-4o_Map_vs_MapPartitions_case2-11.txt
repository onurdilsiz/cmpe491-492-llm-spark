    {
      "operation": "df = json_rdd.map(lambda x: Row(**x)).toDF()",
      "improvementExplanation": "The map() function is used here to convert each element of the RDD into a Row object, which is then converted into a DataFrame. Since this operation involves creating a Row object for each element, it can be optimized by using mapPartitions() to process elements in batches, reducing the overhead of function calls.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "df = json_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: (Row(**x) for x in partition)).toDF()",
      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() reduces the function call overhead by processing elements in batches. This is particularly beneficial when dealing with large datasets, as it can lead to improved performance and resource utilization by minimizing the number of Python function calls and allowing for more efficient memory usage."
