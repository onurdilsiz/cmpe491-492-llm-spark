            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads a text file, which is not optimized for structured data processing. Switching to a format like Parquet or ORC would allow for more efficient data storage and retrieval, as these formats are columnar and support compression and predicate pushdown.",

            "benefits": "Using Parquet would result in faster read operations due to its columnar storage, better compression, and support for predicate pushdown, which can significantly speed up query execution."

            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation writes data in CSV format, which is not efficient for large-scale data processing. Switching to Parquet would improve write performance and reduce storage space due to its efficient compression and encoding.",
