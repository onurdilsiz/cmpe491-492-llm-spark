            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a text file where each line is expected to be a CSV-formatted string. Text files are not optimized for performance in Spark as they do not support columnar storage, compression, or predicate pushdown. Switching to a format like Parquet or ORC would improve performance by enabling these features, which are particularly beneficial for large datasets.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "inputPoints = spark.read.parquet(data_path).repartition(numPartitions=L).rdd.map(lambda row: [row[0], row[1]])",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC provides faster read and write operations due to columnar storage and efficient compression. These formats also support predicate pushdown, which can significantly reduce the amount of data read into memory by filtering data at the storage level. This results in improved query performance and reduced I/O operations."
