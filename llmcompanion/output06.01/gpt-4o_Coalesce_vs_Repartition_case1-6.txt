      "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(200) operation is used to increase the number of partitions to 200 before writing the DataFrame to a CSV file. If the goal is to reduce the number of partitions, coalesce() can be used instead, as it avoids a full shuffle and is more efficient. However, if the intention is to increase the number of partitions, repartition() is necessary. In this case, if the number of partitions is being reduced, coalesce() is more appropriate.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "df_5years.coalesce(200).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").mode(\"overwrite\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000-2005/repartition/200\")",
      "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() reduces the amount of data shuffling across the cluster, leading to improved resource usage and faster job runtime. This is particularly beneficial when reducing the number of partitions, as coalesce() minimizes the overhead associated with data movement."
