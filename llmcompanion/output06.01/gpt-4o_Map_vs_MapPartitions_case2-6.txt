    {
      "operation": "hbase_rdd.map(lambda x: x[1]).map(lambda x: x.split(\"\\n\"))",
      "improvementExplanation": "The map operation is used to extract the second element of each tuple and then split the string by newlines. This can be done more efficiently using mapPartitions, which processes each partition as a whole, reducing the overhead of function calls for each element.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "hbase_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: (x.split(\"\\n\") for x in (row[1] for row in partition)))",
      "benefits": "Using mapPartitions reduces the function call overhead by processing each partition as a whole, which can lead to performance improvements, especially when dealing with large datasets."
    },
    {
      "operation": "data_rdd = data_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda row: get_input(row))",
      "improvementExplanation": "This operation already uses mapPartitions, which is appropriate here because get_input involves loading a model and processing each row, which benefits from being done at the partition level to avoid repeated model loading.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "data_rdd = data_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda row: get_input(row))",
      "benefits": "The use of mapPartitions here is already optimal as it reduces repeated loading of the word2vec model and processes rows in batches, improving I/O efficiency and resource utilization."
    },
    {
      "operation": "result = data_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda iter: predict(iter))",
      "improvementExplanation": "This operation also uses mapPartitions, which is suitable because predict involves loading a TensorFlow model and making predictions, which is more efficient when done at the partition level.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "result = data_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda iter: predict(iter))",
      "benefits": "Using mapPartitions here is beneficial as it minimizes repeated loading of the TensorFlow model and processes data in batches, leading to optimized resource utilization and reduced overhead."
