      "operation": "Read text file using sparkContext.textFile(input_file)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads a text file using the textFile method, which is suitable for simple text data but not optimized for performance. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can improve performance due to their columnar storage, which allows for efficient data compression and faster read times. These formats also support predicate pushdown, which can optimize query performance by filtering data at the storage level.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "file_q3 = spark.read.parquet(input_file)",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC provides faster read and write operations due to efficient compression and encoding. These formats also support predicate pushdown, which can significantly improve query performance by reducing the amount of data read from disk. Additionally, they are well-suited for complex data types and schema evolution."
