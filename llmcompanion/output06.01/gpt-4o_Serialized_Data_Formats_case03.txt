      "operation": "employee_rdd = spark.sparkContext.textFile(\"path/to/employees.txt\")",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a text file using RDDs, which is less efficient compared to using DataFrames with optimized formats like Parquet. Switching to Parquet would allow for better compression and faster read times due to columnar storage.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "employee_df = spark.read.format(\"parquet\").load(\"path/to/employees.parquet\")",
      "benefits": "Using Parquet format would provide faster read times due to its columnar storage, better compression, and support for predicate pushdown, which optimizes query performance."

      "operation": "department_salary_df.write.format(\"csv\").option(\"header\", \"true\").save(\"path/to/department_salary_output.csv\")",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation writes data to a CSV file, which is not optimized for performance. Switching to Parquet format would improve write performance and reduce storage space due to better compression.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "department_salary_df.write.format(\"parquet\").save(\"path/to/department_salary_output.parquet\")",
      "benefits": "Writing to Parquet format would result in faster write operations, reduced storage requirements due to efficient compression, and improved query performance through predicate pushdown and columnar storage."
