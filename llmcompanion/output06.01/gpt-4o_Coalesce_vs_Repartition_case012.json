            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() function is used here to set the number of partitions to 10. However, if the goal is to reduce the number of partitions, coalesce() is more efficient as it avoids a full shuffle. Since the code does not indicate an increase in partitions, coalesce() can be used to reduce the partitions without the overhead of a full shuffle.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "repartitioned_df = usd_transactions_df.coalesce(10)",
            "benefits": "Using coalesce() instead of repartition() reduces the amount of data shuffling across the cluster, leading to improved resource usage and faster job runtime. This is particularly beneficial when reducing the number of partitions, as coalesce() minimizes the data movement required."
