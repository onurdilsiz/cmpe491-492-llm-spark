            "operation": "isDate",
            "improvementExplanation": "The UDF 'isDate' checks if a string can be parsed as a date. While there is no direct built-in function for this, using a combination of 'to_date' and 'isNotNull' can achieve similar functionality.",

            "operation": "URLs2domain",
            "improvementExplanation": "The UDF 'URLs2domain' extracts the root domain from a list of URLs. This operation involves external library usage and string manipulation, which is not directly replaceable with built-in functions. However, if the logic can be implemented using regex or string functions, it could be optimized.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "No direct alternative with built-in functions due to external library dependency.",
            "benefits": "If the logic can be implemented with built-in functions, it would enable Spark optimizations and reduce the overhead associated with Python UDFs."
