      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a text file using RDDs. Switching to a DataFrame and reading from a Parquet file would be more efficient. Parquet is a columnar storage format that provides efficient data compression and encoding schemes, resulting in better performance.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "log_df = spark.read.format(\"parquet\").load(\"path/to/logs.parquet\")",
      "benefits": "Using Parquet format allows for faster read operations due to its columnar storage, better compression, and support for predicate pushdown, which can significantly improve query performance."

      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation writes data to a CSV file. Writing to a Parquet file would be more efficient. Parquet supports efficient compression and encoding, which reduces storage space and improves read/write performance.",

      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet format results in faster write operations, reduced storage space due to better compression, and improved read performance through columnar storage and predicate pushdown capabilities."
