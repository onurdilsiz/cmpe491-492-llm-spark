            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a CSV file. CSV is a text-based format that is not optimized for performance in terms of read/write speed or storage efficiency. Switching to a format like Parquet would improve performance due to its columnar storage, which allows for efficient compression and faster query execution through techniques like predicate pushdown.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "csvDF = spark.read.parquet('/hdfs/path/to/processed/fsck/extract/fsck_allBlockFiles_' + curr_date + '.parquet')",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet provides faster read and write operations due to its columnar storage format. It also offers better compression, reducing storage costs. Additionally, Parquet supports predicate pushdown, which can significantly speed up query execution by filtering data at the storage level."
