    {
      "operation": "repartitioned_df = transactions_df.repartition(10)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() function is used here to increase the number of partitions to 10, which causes a full shuffle of the data. Since the goal is to increase the number of partitions, repartition() is appropriate. However, if the intention was to reduce the number of partitions, coalesce() would be more efficient as it avoids a full shuffle by merging partitions.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "repartitioned_df = transactions_df.coalesce(10)",
      "benefits": "Using coalesce() instead of repartition() would reduce the amount of data shuffling, leading to improved resource usage and faster job runtime, especially when reducing the number of partitions."
