            "improvementExplanation": "The map() function is used to split each line of the sales data into a list of elements. This operation can be performed at the partition level using mapPartitions(), which processes all elements of a partition in a single function call, reducing the overhead of multiple function calls.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "parsed_sales_rdd = sales_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda lines: (line.split(\",\") for line in lines))",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() reduces the function call overhead by processing each partition as a whole. This is particularly beneficial for I/O-heavy operations, as it allows for more efficient data processing and resource utilization by minimizing the number of function invocations."
