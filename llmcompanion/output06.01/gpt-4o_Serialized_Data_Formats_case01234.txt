      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a CSV file. CSV is a text-based format that is not optimized for performance in Spark. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC can improve performance due to better compression, faster read/write operations, and support for predicate pushdown, which can optimize query execution.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "parquet_df = spark.read.format(\"parquet\").load(\"path/to/data.parquet\")",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet provides faster read/write operations due to its columnar storage format, better compression, and support for predicate pushdown, which can significantly improve query performance by reducing the amount of data read."
