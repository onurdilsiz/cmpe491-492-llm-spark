            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads a text file, which is not optimized for structured data processing. Switching to a format like Parquet or ORC would allow for more efficient storage and retrieval, as these formats are columnar and support compression and predicate pushdown.",

            "benefits": "Using Parquet would result in faster read operations due to its columnar storage, better compression, and support for predicate pushdown, which can significantly reduce the amount of data read."

            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation writes data in CSV format, which is not efficient for large-scale data processing. Switching to Parquet would improve write performance and reduce storage space due to its efficient compression and encoding.",

            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet would provide faster write operations, better compression, and reduced storage requirements. Additionally, Parquet's columnar format allows for efficient querying and data retrieval."
