            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() function is used here to distribute the DataFrame into a specified number of partitions based on the '_salted_key'. Since the number of partitions is determined by the maximum number of files calculated earlier, it is likely that the intention is to reduce the number of partitions. If the goal is to reduce the number of partitions, coalesce() can be used instead, as it avoids a full shuffle and is more efficient for reducing partitions.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df = df.coalesce(number_of_files).drop('_salted_key')",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() reduces the amount of data shuffling across the cluster, leading to improved resource usage and faster job runtime. This is particularly beneficial when the number of partitions is being reduced, as coalesce() is optimized for this purpose."
