            "improvementExplanation": "The UDF 'splitPathsUDF' is used to split a string path into an array of paths by iteratively finding the '/' character. This can be replaced with Spark's built-in 'split' function, which can split a string into an array based on a delimiter. However, the current logic of the UDF is to create a list of substrings up to each '/' character, which is not directly achievable with 'split'. Instead, we can use a combination of 'split' and 'posexplode' to achieve a similar result.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "from pyspark.sql.functions import split, posexplode\n\n# Use split to create an array of path components\nsplitPathsDF = csvDF.withColumn(\"PathArray\", split(csvDF[\"Path\"], \"/\"))\n\n# Use posexplode to explode the array and get the position\nexplodedPaths = splitPathsDF.selectExpr(\"posexplode(PathArray) as (pos, Path)\")",
            "benefits": "Replacing UDFs with built-in functions like 'split' and 'posexplode' allows Spark to optimize the query using Catalyst, improving performance by reducing serialization overhead and enabling better execution planning. Built-in functions are executed in the JVM, avoiding the need to serialize data to Python, which can significantly enhance performance."
