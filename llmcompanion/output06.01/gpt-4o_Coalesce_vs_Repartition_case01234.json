            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() function is used to increase the number of partitions to 10. However, if the goal is to reduce the number of partitions or if the current number of partitions is greater than 10, coalesce() can be used instead. Coalesce() is more efficient for reducing the number of partitions because it avoids a full shuffle, unlike repartition().",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "coalesced_df = df.coalesce(10)",
            "benefits": "Using coalesce() reduces the amount of data shuffling across the cluster, leading to improved resource usage and faster job runtime. It is particularly beneficial when decreasing the number of partitions."
