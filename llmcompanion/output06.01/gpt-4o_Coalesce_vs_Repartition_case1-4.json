            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() function is used here to increase the number of partitions to 50 before writing the DataFrame to a CSV file. Since the operation is writing data and not increasing the number of partitions, coalesce() can be used instead to reduce the number of partitions without a full shuffle, assuming the current number of partitions is greater than 50.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df_5years.coalesce(50).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").mode(\"overwrite\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000-2005/repartition/50\")",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() reduces the amount of data shuffling across the cluster, leading to improved resource usage and faster job runtime. This is particularly beneficial when reducing the number of partitions, as coalesce() avoids the full shuffle that repartition() would perform."
