      "improvementExplanation": "The map() function is used to parse each line of the text file into a list of floats. This operation can be performed at the partition level using mapPartitions() to reduce the overhead of function calls by processing multiple lines at once.",

      "benefits": "Using mapPartitions() reduces the function call overhead by processing multiple lines in a single call, which can lead to improved performance, especially for large datasets."

      "operation": "A_AT_A = A.map(lambda row: np.dot(row, AT_A))",
      "improvementExplanation": "The map() function is used to compute the dot product of each row with the matrix AT_A. This operation can be performed at the partition level using mapPartitions() to batch the dot product calculations, which can be more efficient.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "A_AT_A = A.mapPartitions(lambda rows: (np.dot(row, AT_A) for row in rows))",
      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() allows for batching of dot product calculations, reducing the overhead of repeated function calls and potentially improving performance by leveraging partition-level optimizations."
