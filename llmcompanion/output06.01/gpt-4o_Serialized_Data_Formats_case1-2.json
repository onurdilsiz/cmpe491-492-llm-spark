            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads a text file, which is not optimized for structured data processing. Switching to a format like Parquet would allow for more efficient storage and retrieval, as Parquet is a columnar format that supports efficient compression and encoding schemes.",

            "benefits": "Using Parquet can lead to faster read times due to its columnar storage, better compression, and support for predicate pushdown, which can reduce the amount of data read."

            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation writes data in CSV format, which is not optimized for large-scale data processing. Switching to Parquet would improve write performance and reduce storage space due to its efficient compression and encoding.",
