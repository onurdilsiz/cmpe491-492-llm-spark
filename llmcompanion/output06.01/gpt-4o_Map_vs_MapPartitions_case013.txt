      "improvementExplanation": "The map() function is used here to parse each line of the text file into a structured format. This operation can be performed at the partition level using mapPartitions(), which processes all records in a partition with a single function call, reducing overhead. This is particularly beneficial if the parsing operation is lightweight and can be batched for efficiency.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "parsed_transactions_rdd = transactions_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda lines: (line.split(\",\") for line in lines))",
      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() reduces the function call overhead by processing multiple records at once. It optimizes resource utilization and can improve performance, especially for I/O-heavy operations or when the transformation logic can be applied to batches of records."
