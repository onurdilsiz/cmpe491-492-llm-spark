            "improvementExplanation": "The UDF 'create_greeting' is used to generate a greeting message for each customer. This can be replaced with Spark's built-in 'concat' function to achieve the same result without using a UDF. The 'concat' function can concatenate strings directly in a DataFrame operation.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "from pyspark.sql.functions import concat, lit\n\ncustomer_with_greeting_df = customer_df.withColumn(\"greeting\", concat(lit(\"Hello, \"), customer_df[\"name\"], lit(\"!\")))",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with a built-in function like 'concat' allows Spark to leverage Catalyst optimizations, which can improve query planning and execution. It also reduces serialization overhead and can lead to better performance by avoiding the need to execute Python code for each row."
