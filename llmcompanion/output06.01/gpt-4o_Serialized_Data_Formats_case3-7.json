            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a CSV file using pandas. CSV is a text-based format that is not optimized for performance in distributed computing environments like Spark. Switching to a format like Parquet or ORC, which are columnar storage formats, can significantly improve performance due to better compression, faster read/write operations, and support for predicate pushdown.",

            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet provides faster read/write operations due to its columnar storage, better compression, and support for predicate pushdown, which can optimize query performance by filtering data early in the processing pipeline."
