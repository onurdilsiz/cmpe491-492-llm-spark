      "improvementExplanation": "The map() transformation is used to parse each line in the sales_rdd into a list. However, this operation can be performed at the partition level, which means it can be optimized by using mapPartitions(). This is because map() applies the lambda function to each element in the RDD, whereas mapPartitions() applies the function to each partition of the RDD. In this case, since the lambda function is I/O-heavy (it involves splitting each line), using mapPartitions() can reduce the number of function calls and improve performance.",
