            "improvementExplanation": "The current data format is CSV, which is a simple text format. Switching to an optimized serialized format like Parquet or ORC would improve performance by reducing the size of the data and enabling faster reads/writes. Parquet and ORC are columnar storage formats that are optimized for querying and analysis. They provide features like compression, encoding, and predicate pushdown, which can significantly improve query performance.",

For example:\nspark.read.parquet(file_path_spam).load()\nspark.read.parquet(file_path_non_spam).load()\nThis will load the Parquet files into DataFrames, which can be used for further analysis.",
