      "improvementExplanation": "The udf_executeRestApi is used to execute the executeRestApi function for each row in the DataFrame. This operation can be performed at the partition level, as it involves batching or I/O-heavy operations. By using mapPartitions(), we can reduce the function call overhead and optimize I/O.",
