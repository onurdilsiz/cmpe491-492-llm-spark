      "improvementExplanation": "The UDF is used to create a custom message for each transaction. However, this can be achieved using Spark's built-in string formatting functions. The `withColumn` method can be used to create a new column with the desired string format.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "transactions_with_message_df = repartitioned_df.withColumn(\"transaction_message\", concat(lit(\"Category: \"), repartitioned_df[\"category\"], lit(\" , Amount: $\"), repartitioned_df[\"amount\"], lit(\"\")))",
      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with a built-in function enables Catalyst optimizations, improves performance, and reduces serialization overhead. This is because built-in functions are optimized for Spark's execution engine and do not require the overhead of UDF registration and serialization."
