            "improvementExplanation": "The map() transformation is used to split each line of the HBase result into individual elements. However, this operation can be performed at the partition level, as it involves batching and processing multiple lines together. By using mapPartitions(), we can reduce the number of function calls and improve performance.",

            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() can reduce function call overhead, optimize I/O operations, and improve resource utilization by processing multiple lines together."

            "improvementExplanation": "The mapPartitions() transformation is already used in this case. However, the predict() function inside it uses map() to load the word2vec model and generate input vectors. This operation can be further optimized by using mapPartitions() to load the model and generate input vectors at the partition level.",
