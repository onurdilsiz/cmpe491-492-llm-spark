      "rddOperation": "textFile() and collect()",
      "improvementExplanation": "The textFile() operation reads the input file into an RDD, which can be inefficient for large files. The collect() operation then gathers all the data into the driver node, which can lead to memory issues and slow performance. DataFrames can handle large files more efficiently and provide better performance.",

The collect() operation then gathers all the data into the driver node, which can lead to memory issues and slow performance.
