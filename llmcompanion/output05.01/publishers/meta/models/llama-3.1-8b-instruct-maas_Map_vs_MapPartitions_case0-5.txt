      "improvementExplanation": "The map() transformation is used to apply the state_convert function to each element in the RDD. However, since the state_convert function is a simple dictionary lookup, it can be performed at the partition level using mapPartitions(). This is because the function does not depend on the order of elements in the RDD and can be applied in parallel to each partition.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: [(x[0], x[1], x[2], broadcastStates.value[x[3]]) for x in partition]).collect()",
      "benefits": [
        "Reduced function call overhead by applying the state_convert function in parallel to each partition.",
        "Optimized I/O by processing each partition independently, reducing the need for inter-partition communication.",
        "Improved resource utilization by leveraging the parallelism of the Spark cluster to apply the state_convert function."
