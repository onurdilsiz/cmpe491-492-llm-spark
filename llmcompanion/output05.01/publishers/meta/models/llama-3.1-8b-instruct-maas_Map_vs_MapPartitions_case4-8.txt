      "improvementExplanation": "The map() transformation is used to apply the __URL2domain() function to each URL in the list. This operation can be performed at the partition level, as it involves batching and processing a list of URLs. By using mapPartitions(), we can take advantage of the partition-level processing to reduce the number of function calls and improve performance.",

      "benefits": [
        "Reduced function call overhead",
