            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used to redistribute the data to 100 partitions. However, since the data is already grouped by key, we can use coalesce() to reduce the number of partitions instead of redistributing the data. This is because coalesce() reduces the number of partitions by merging them, whereas repartition() redistributes the data to the specified number of partitions.",

            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() reduces shuffling, improves resource usage, and results in faster job runtime."
