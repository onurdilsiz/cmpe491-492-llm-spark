      "improvementExplanation": "The repartition operation is used to redistribute the data across the cluster, which can lead to a full shuffle. However, in this case, reducing the number of partitions from the default value to 100 might be sufficient. This can be achieved using coalesce(100), which will reduce the number of partitions without triggering a full shuffle.",

      "operation": "termDocMatrix.cache()",
      "improvementExplanation": "The cache operation is not directly related to repartition, but it's worth noting that caching a DataFrame after a repartition operation can lead to memory issues. However, in this case, the repartition operation is used before caching, which means that the data is already distributed across the cluster. To improve efficiency, consider using coalesce() instead of repartition() to reduce the number of partitions.",
