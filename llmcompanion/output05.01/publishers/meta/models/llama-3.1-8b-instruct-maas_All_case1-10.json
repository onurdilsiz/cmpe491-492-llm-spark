This is because foreachPartition is an action that applies a function to each partition of the RDD, whereas DataFrames/Datasets are designed for efficient data processing and can be optimized for performance. By converting the RDD to a DataFrame/Dataset, you can take advantage of Spark's Catalyst optimizer and query planning capabilities, which can lead to improved performance and reduced shuffling.",
