      "improvementExplanation": "The operation requires a full shuffle, which can be avoided by using coalesce(). The current repartition() operation is used to remove rows with any null value, which can be done in-place without shuffling the data. By using coalesce(), we can reduce the number of partitions and improve resource usage.",
