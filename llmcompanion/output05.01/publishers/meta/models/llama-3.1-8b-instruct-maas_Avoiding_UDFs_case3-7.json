            "operation": "eval_metrics function (line 24)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The eval_metrics function can be replaced with Spark's built-in functions for calculating mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared. This is because Spark provides optimized implementations for these metrics, which can take advantage of Catalyst optimizations and improve performance.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "You can use the following Spark SQL functions to calculate the metrics:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col\n\nrmse = sqrt(mean_squared_error(col('actual'), col('pred')))\nmae = mean_absolute_error(col('actual'), col('pred'))\nr2 = r2_score(col('actual'), col('pred'))\n\nreturn rmse, mae, r2\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the following native DataFrame/Dataset operations:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col\n\nrmse = sqrt((col('actual') - col('pred')) ** 2).mean()\nmae = (col('actual') - col('pred')).abs().mean()\nr2 = 1 - ((col('actual') - col('pred')) ** 2).mean() / (col('actual').std() ** 2)\n\nreturn rmse, mae, r2\n```\n",
            "benefits": "Replacing UDFs with built-in functions or native DataFrame/Dataset operations can bring several benefits, including:\n\n* Enabling Catalyst optimizations, which can improve performance and reduce memory usage.\n* Reducing serialization overhead, as built-in functions and native operations are optimized for Spark's internal data structures.\n* Improving code readability and maintainability, as built-in functions and native operations are often more concise and expressive than UDFs."
