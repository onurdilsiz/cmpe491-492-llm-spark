      "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() function is used to change the number of partitions in the DataFrame. However, in this case, it's being used unnecessarily, causing a full shuffle. This can be avoided by using the coalesce() function instead, which is more efficient for reducing the number of partitions.",

      "improvementExplanation": "The filter() function is used to filter the DataFrame based on a condition. However, in this case, it's being used with a UDF-like operation (repartitioned_df['category'] == 'Electronics'). This can be avoided by using a native DataFrame/Dataset operation, such as a simple equality check.",

      "improvementExplanation": "The write.format() function is used to save the DataFrame in a specific format. However, in this case, it's being used to save the data in CSV format, which is not the most efficient format for storing data. This can be avoided by using a more efficient format like Parquet.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "electronics_df.write.format('parquet').option('header', 'true').save('path/to/electronics_sales_output.parquet')",
