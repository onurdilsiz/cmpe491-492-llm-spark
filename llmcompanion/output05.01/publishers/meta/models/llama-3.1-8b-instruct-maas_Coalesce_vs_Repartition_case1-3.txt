      "improvementExplanation": "The repartition operation is used to redistribute the data across the cluster, which can lead to a full shuffle. However, in this case, the number of partitions is being reduced from the default value to 200. This can be achieved using coalesce, which reduces the number of partitions without triggering a full shuffle.",

      "benefits": "Switching to coalesce can reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and result in a faster job runtime."
