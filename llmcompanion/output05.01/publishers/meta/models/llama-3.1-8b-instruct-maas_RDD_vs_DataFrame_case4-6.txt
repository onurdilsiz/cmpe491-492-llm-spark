However, if we were to assume that the UDFs are being used on an RDD and we were to provide a code example, here is the corrected response:

{
  "detected": true,
  "occurrences": 0,
  "response": [
    {
      "rddOperation": "None",
      "improvementExplanation": "No explicit RDD operations were detected in the provided code. However, the usage of UDFs (User-Defined Functions) can be improved by using DataFrame/Dataset APIs for better performance and scalability.",

Here is an example of how you can use the `withColumn` method to create new columns with the desired transformations:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import regexp_replace, lower

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Example").getOrCreate()

# Create a sample DataFrame
data = [
    ("John Doe", "123456789", "masculino", "01/01/2022"),
    ("Jane Doe", "987654321", "feminino", "02/02/2023")
]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["full_name", "phone", "gender", "date"])

# Use the withColumn method to create new columns with the desired transformations
df = df.withColumn("family_name", regexp_replace(df.full_name, r"^\w+\s", "")). \
       withColumn("given_name", lower(df.full_name).substr(1, 1)). \
       withColumn("clean_phone", regexp_replace(df.phone, r"\D", "")). \
       withColumn("clean_gender", lower(df.gender)). \
       withColumn("formatted_date", regexp_replace(df.date, r"\D", ""))

# Print the resulting DataFrame
df.show()
```

This code creates a sample DataFrame with the desired columns and uses the `withColumn` method to create new columns with the desired transformations. The `regexp_replace` function is used to replace phone numbers and the `lower` function is used to clean the gender column. The resulting DataFrame is then printed to the console.
