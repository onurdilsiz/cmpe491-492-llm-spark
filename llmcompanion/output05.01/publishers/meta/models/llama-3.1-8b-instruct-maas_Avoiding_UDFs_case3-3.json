            "improvementExplanation": "The Imputer UDF is used to impute missing values in the 'age', 'Experience', and 'Salary' columns. However, Spark provides a built-in Imputer class in the pyspark.ml.feature module that can be used for this purpose. The Imputer UDF can be replaced with the built-in Imputer class, which provides more flexibility and control over the imputation process.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "imputer = Imputer(inputCols=['age', 'Experience', 'Salary'], outputCols=['{}_imputed'.format(c) for c in ['Age', 'Experience', 'Salary']]).setStrategy('mean')\nimputer.fit(df_pyspark).transform(df_pyspark).show()",
            "benefits": "Replacing the Imputer UDF with the built-in Imputer class enables Catalyst optimizations, improves performance, and reduces serialization overhead. The built-in Imputer class is optimized for Spark's Catalyst engine, which can lead to significant performance improvements compared to using a UDF."
