            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used to redistribute the data after adding a new column. However, in this case, the new column is added using a UDF, which does not require a full shuffle. Therefore, coalesce() can be used to reduce the number of partitions without incurring a full shuffle.",

            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() can reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and result in a faster job runtime."
