            "improvementExplanation": "The transform() method of the indexer is likely performing a map operation on the input data. This operation can be performed at the partition level, as it involves applying a transformation to each row of the data. By using mapPartitions(), we can reduce the function call overhead and optimize I/O operations, leading to improved performance.",

                "Reduced function call overhead",
                "Optimized I/O operations",
                "Improved performance for partition-level operations"
