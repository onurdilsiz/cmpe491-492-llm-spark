      "improvementExplanation": "The current data format is a list of tuples, which is not an optimized format for large-scale data processing. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can improve performance by reducing the time it takes to read and write data. Parquet and ORC are columnar storage formats that are optimized for query performance and can provide faster reads and writes compared to CSV or JSON.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "You can use the `toParquet` method to write the result to a Parquet file, and then read it back using the `readParquet` method. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nrdd2.toParquet('output.parquet')\nspark.read.parquet('output.parquet').show()\n```\nThis will write the result to a Parquet file named `output.parquet` and then read it back and display it in the console.",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC can provide faster reads and writes, compression, and query optimization through predicate pushdown."
