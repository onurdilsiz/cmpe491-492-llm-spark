      "improvementExplanation": "The HashingTF UDF is used to map each word to one feature. However, this can be replaced with a native DataFrame/Dataset operation using the 'map' function and a lambda expression. This approach enables Catalyst optimizations, improves performance, and reduces serialization overhead.",
