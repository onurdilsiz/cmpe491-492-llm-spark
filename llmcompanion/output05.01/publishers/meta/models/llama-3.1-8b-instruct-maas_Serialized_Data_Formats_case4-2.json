            "improvementExplanation": "The current data format being used is likely CSV, which can be slow for large datasets due to its text-based format. Switching to an optimized serialized format like Parquet or ORC would improve performance by reducing the time it takes to read and write data. Parquet and ORC are columnar storage formats that provide faster reads and writes, compression, and query optimization through predicate pushdown.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "You can replace the create_standard_df() function with a function that reads data from a Parquet file. For example:\n\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\nspark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()\ndf = spark.read.parquet('path_to_your_parquet_file')",
