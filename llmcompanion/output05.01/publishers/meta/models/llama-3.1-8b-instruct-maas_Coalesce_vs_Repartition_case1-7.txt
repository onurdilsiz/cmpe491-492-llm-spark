      "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used to redistribute the data based on the '_salted_key' column. However, since the number of partitions is fixed and known in advance (number_of_files), we can use coalesce() instead. coalesce() will reduce the number of partitions to the specified number without shuffling the data, which can lead to improved resource usage and faster job runtime.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "df = df.coalesce(number_of_files).drop('_salted_key')",
      "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() will reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and result in a faster job runtime."
