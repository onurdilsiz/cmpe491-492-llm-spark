      "operation": "repartitioned_df = filtered_transactions_df.repartition(10)  # Inefficient partitioning",
      "improvementExplanation": "The purpose of using repartition() in this context is to change the number of partitions in the DataFrame. However, this operation requires a full shuffle, which can be inefficient. In this case, the number of partitions is being reduced from the default value to 10, which is not necessary if the goal is to reduce the number of partitions. A full shuffle is required because the number of partitions is being changed, not just reduced.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "repartitioned_df = filtered_transactions_df.coalesce(10)",
      "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() would reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and result in a faster job runtime. This is because coalesce() reduces the number of partitions without requiring a full shuffle, which can be more efficient than repartition()."
