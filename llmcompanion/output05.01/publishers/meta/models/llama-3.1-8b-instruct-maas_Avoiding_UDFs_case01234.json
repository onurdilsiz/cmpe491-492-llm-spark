            "improvementExplanation": "The UDF 'multiply_by_two' is used to multiply the 'numbers' column by 2. This operation can be replaced with the built-in Spark SQL function 'col(\"numbers\") * 2'. Using a UDF introduces additional overhead due to serialization and deserialization of the function, whereas a built-in function can be optimized by the Catalyst optimizer.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "result_with_udf = df.withColumn(\"doubled\", col(\"numbers\") * 2)",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with a built-in function enables Catalyst optimizations, improves performance, and reduces serialization overhead."
