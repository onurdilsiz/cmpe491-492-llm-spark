Parquet and ORC are columnar storage formats that provide faster reads and writes compared to text files. They also support compression, which can reduce storage costs and improve query performance. Additionally, Parquet and ORC support predicate pushdown, which allows the query engine to filter out unnecessary data before it is read from storage, further improving query performance.",
