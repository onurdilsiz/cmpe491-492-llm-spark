            "improvementExplanation": "The synthetic_page_skeleton_and_paragraphs_udf function is used to create a new Page.skeleton with synthetic entity linking and paragraph list. This function is called for each row in the DataFrame, which means it is executed for each partition. However, the function itself does not perform any partition-level operations. It only processes the data in each row. Therefore, using map() is sufficient in this case. Nevertheless, if the function were to perform any I/O-heavy operations or batch processing, it would be beneficial to use mapPartitions() to take advantage of the partition-level processing.",

However, if the function were to be modified to perform I/O-heavy operations or batch processing, using mapPartitions() would reduce function call overhead, optimize I/O, and improve resource utilization."
