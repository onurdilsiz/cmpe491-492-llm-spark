            "improvementExplanation": "The current data format is a text file, which is not optimized for performance. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC would improve performance by reducing the time it takes to read and write data. Parquet and ORC are columnar storage formats that are designed to handle large datasets and provide faster query performance. They also support compression, which can reduce storage costs and improve data transfer times.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "You can use the `read.parquet()` method to read the data from a Parquet file instead of a text file. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nemployee_df = spark.read.parquet('path/to/employees.parquet')\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `read.orc()` method to read the data from an ORC file:\n\n```python\nemployee_df = spark.read.orc('path/to/employees.orc')\n```\n\nMake sure to replace the file path with the actual path to your Parquet or ORC file.",
