            "improvementExplanation": "The map() transformation is used to apply the five_udf function to each row in the DataFrame. However, since the function is a simple UDF that returns a constant value, it can be optimized by using mapPartitions(). This is because the function does not depend on the data itself, but rather on the partition boundaries. By using mapPartitions(), we can reduce the function call overhead and optimize I/O operations.",
