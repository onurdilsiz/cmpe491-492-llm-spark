            "improvementExplanation": "The map() transformation is used for element-wise processing of each row in the sales_rdd. However, this operation can be performed at the partition level, which would be more efficient. Since the operation involves a simple arithmetic calculation, it can be batched together with other rows in the same partition, reducing the number of function calls and improving performance.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "sales_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: [tuple(row) for row in partition])\n    .map(lambda row: (row[0], row[1], row[2] * 0.9))",
            "benefits": [
                "Reduced function call overhead",
                "Optimized I/O by batching operations together",
                "Improved performance for partition-level operations"
