            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used to reduce the number of partitions from the default value to 1. However, this operation requires a full shuffle, which can be expensive. In this case, coalesce() can be used instead, which reduces the number of partitions without a full shuffle. This is because the number of partitions is being reduced, not increased.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "azureAuditLog_df_dynf = DynamicFrame.fromDF(azureAuditLog_df, glueContext, \"dynamic_frame\").coalesce(1)",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() reduces shuffling, improves resource usage, and results in a faster job runtime."
