      "improvementExplanation": "The UDF is used to parse the transaction data from a text file into a structured format. However, this can be achieved more efficiently using the `split()` function directly on the DataFrame or Dataset, which would enable Catalyst optimizations and reduce serialization overhead.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "parsed_transactions_df = transactions_df.selectExpr(\"split(value, \",\") as transaction_array\")",
      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with a built-in function would enable Catalyst optimizations, improve performance, and reduce serialization overhead."
