      "improvementExplanation": "The UDF operation 'substr' can be replaced with the built-in function 'substring' or native DataFrame/Dataset operation 'substr'. The 'substr' function is used to extract a substring from a string. In this case, it's used to extract the 'Weather_Station' from the 'value' column. However, the 'substring' function is more efficient and can be used directly on the DataFrame/Dataset.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "df1['value'].substring(5, 6)",
      "benefits": "Replacing UDFs with built-in functions or native DataFrame/Dataset operations can improve performance by enabling Catalyst optimizations, reducing serialization overhead, and making the code more efficient."
