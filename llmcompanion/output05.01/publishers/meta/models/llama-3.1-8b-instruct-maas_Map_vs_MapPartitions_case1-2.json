            "improvementExplanation": "The substr operation is used to extract a substring from the 'value' column. This operation can be performed at the partition level, as it involves batching or I/O-heavy operations. By using mapPartitions(), we can reduce the function call overhead and optimize I/O.",

                "Reduced function call overhead",
