      "operation": "Creating a DataFrame from a list of tuples (line 9)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current data format is a list of tuples, which is not an optimized format for storing and processing large datasets. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC would improve performance by enabling faster reads and writes, as well as compression and query optimization through predicate pushdown.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "You can use the `toParquet()` method to write the DataFrame to a Parquet file, and then read it back using the `readParquet()` method. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nsales_df.write.parquet('sales_data.parquet')\nsales_df_optimized = spark.read.parquet('sales_data.parquet')\n```\nThis will create a Parquet file named `sales_data.parquet` and read it back into a new DataFrame named `sales_df_optimized`.",
