            "improvementExplanation": "The current data format being used is CSV, which is a non-optimized format for storing and querying large datasets. CSV files do not support compression, and they can be slow to read and write. Switching to an optimized serialized format like Parquet or ORC would improve performance by enabling faster reads and writes, compression, and query optimization through predicate pushdown.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "To replace the current operation with one using an optimized serialized format like Parquet, you can use the following code snippet:\nelectronics_df.write.format(\"parquet\").option(\"header\", \"true\").save(\"path/to/electronics_sales_output.parquet\")",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet would provide faster reads and writes, compression, and query optimization through predicate pushdown."

            "improvementExplanation": "The current code is repartitioning the DataFrame unnecessarily, causing a full shuffle. This can be optimized by using coalesce() instead of repartition() when the number of partitions is being reduced. Additionally, using a more efficient data format like Parquet would reduce the need for repartitioning.",
