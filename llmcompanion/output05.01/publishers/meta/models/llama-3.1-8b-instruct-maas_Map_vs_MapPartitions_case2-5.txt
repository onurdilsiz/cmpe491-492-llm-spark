      "improvementExplanation": "The map() operation is used to apply the lemmatization pipeline to each token in the plain text. However, this operation can be performed at the partition level, as it involves batching and processing a large number of tokens. By using mapPartitions(), we can reduce the function call overhead and optimize I/O operations.",
