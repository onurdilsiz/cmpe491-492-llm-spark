            "improvementExplanation": "The map operation is used to apply a user-defined function (UDF) to each element of the array. However, in the provided code, the UDF is applied using the `udf` function from PySpark, which is not an RDD operation. Nevertheless, the UDF itself uses a list comprehension, which can be replaced with a more efficient DataFrame/Dataset operation.",

                "description": "The UDF is replaced with a simple Python function that uses a list comprehension. This function is then applied to the DataFrame using the `withColumn` method."

            "benefits": [
                "Improved performance: The list comprehension is more efficient than the original UDF.",
                "Better resource usage: The UDF is replaced with a simple Python function, which reduces the overhead of creating and managing a UDF.",
                "Simplified code: The code is simplified by removing the need for a UDF and using a more efficient list comprehension."
