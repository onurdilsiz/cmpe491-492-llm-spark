      "rddOperation": "map",
      "improvementExplanation": "The map operation is used to apply a function to each element of the RDD. In this case, the function is used to convert a string to title case. This operation can be improved by using the to_upper() function provided by the DataFrame API, which is more efficient and scalable.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": {
        "code": "df.select(col('Seqno'), convertUDF(col('Name')).alias('Name'))",
        "explanation": "This code snippet uses the select() method of the DataFrame API to apply the convertUDF() function to each element of the 'Name' column. The result is a new DataFrame with the converted values."
      },
      "benefits": [
        "Improved performance: The DataFrame API is optimized for performance and scalability, making it a better choice for large datasets.",
        "Reduced shuffling: The DataFrame API minimizes shuffling, which reduces the overhead of data movement and improves overall performance.",
        "Better resource usage: The DataFrame API is designed to use resources more efficiently, reducing the risk of resource bottlenecks and improving overall system stability."
