      "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used to change the number of partitions in the airbnb_df DataFrame. However, in this case, it's used to simulate a different cluster configuration. If the goal is to reduce the number of partitions, coalesce() can be used instead. Coalesce() reduces the number of partitions without shuffling the data, which can lead to improved performance and reduced resource usage.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "airbnb_df.coalesce(24)",
      "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() can reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and lead to faster job runtime."
