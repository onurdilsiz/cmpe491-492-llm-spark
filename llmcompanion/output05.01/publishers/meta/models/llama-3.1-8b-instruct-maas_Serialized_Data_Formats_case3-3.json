            "improvementExplanation": "The current data format being used is CSV, which is a text-based format. Switching to an optimized serialized format like Parquet or ORC would improve performance by reducing the time it takes to read and write data. Parquet and ORC are columnar storage formats that are optimized for querying and analysis. They provide faster reads and writes, compression, and query optimization through predicate pushdown.",
