      "operation": "filtered_product_category_rdd = filtered_no_number_failure_reason_rdd.filter(...).repartition(4)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used to change the number of partitions in the filtered_product_category_rdd dataset. However, since the number of partitions is being reduced from an unknown number to 4, it is likely that a full shuffle is not necessary. In this case, coalesce() can be used instead of repartition() to reduce the number of partitions without triggering a full shuffle.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "filtered_product_category_rdd = filtered_no_number_failure_reason_rdd.filter(...).coalesce(4)",
      "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() will reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and result in a faster job runtime."
