      "improvementExplanation": "The repartition operation is used to reduce the number of partitions to 1, which is typically used for writing data to a single file. However, this operation requires a full shuffle, which can be expensive. In this case, coalesce can be used instead, which reduces the number of partitions without a full shuffle.",

      "benefits": "Switching to coalesce reduces shuffling, improves resource usage, and results in faster job runtime."
