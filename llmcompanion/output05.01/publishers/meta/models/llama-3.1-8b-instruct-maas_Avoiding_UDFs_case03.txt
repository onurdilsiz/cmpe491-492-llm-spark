      "improvementExplanation": "The UDF used here is inefficient because it uses the map() function on an RDD, which is not optimized for data processing. Instead, you can use the `spark.read.text()` function to read the text file and then use the `split()` function on the resulting DataFrame to split the lines into columns.",

      "improvementExplanation": "The UDF used here is not necessary because you can directly create a DataFrame from the RDD using the `toDF()` function. However, the `toDF()` function is not necessary in this case because the resulting DataFrame will have the same schema as the RDD.",
