      "improvementExplanation": "The current map operation is used to perform column-wise operations on the DataFrame. However, this operation can be performed at the partition level using mapPartitions(). This is because the operations (year, month, dayofmonth) are applied to each row in the DataFrame, which can be batched together for more efficient processing. By using mapPartitions(), we can reduce the number of function calls and improve performance.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "df = df.rdd.mapPartitions(lambda x: [year(row[0].cast(\"timestamp\")), month(row[0].cast(\"timestamp\")), dayofmonth(row[0].cast(\"timestamp\"))] for row in x).toDF().repartition(1000)",
