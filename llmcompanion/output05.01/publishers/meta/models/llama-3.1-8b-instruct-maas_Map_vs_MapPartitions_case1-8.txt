      "improvementExplanation": "The VectorAssembler operation is used to concatenate the values for each predictor and put them in a vector. This operation can be performed at the partition level, as it involves batching and I/O-heavy operations. By using mapPartitions(), we can take advantage of the partition-level parallelism and reduce the function call overhead.",

      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() can provide several benefits, including reduced function call overhead, optimized I/O, and improved resource utilization. By performing the VectorAssembler operation at the partition level, we can take advantage of the partition-level parallelism and reduce the overhead of function calls. This can lead to improved performance and scalability for large datasets."
