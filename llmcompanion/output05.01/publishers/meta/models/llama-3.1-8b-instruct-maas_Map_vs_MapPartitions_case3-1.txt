      "operation": "generate_rolling_aggregate() function in feature engineering",
      "improvementExplanation": "The generate_rolling_aggregate() function is used to calculate rolling aggregates, which can be performed at the partition level. This operation involves batching and I/O-heavy operations, making it a good candidate for mapPartitions(). By using mapPartitions(), the function can process each partition independently, reducing the overhead of function calls and improving performance.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "You can replace the map() operation with mapPartitions() as follows:\n```python\ndef generate_rolling_aggregate_map_partitions(df, col, operation, timestamp_col, window_in_minutes):\n    # Your existing code here\n\ndf = df.rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partitions: generate_rolling_aggregate_map_partitions(partitions, col, operation, timestamp_col, window_in_minutes)).toDF()\n```\nThis will allow you to process each partition independently, reducing the overhead of function calls and improving performance.",
