      "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the partial_sum_rdd RDD. However, this is not necessary in this case because the subsequent operations (reduceByKey and map) do not require a full shuffle. Reducing the number of partitions using coalesce() would be more efficient.",

      "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() would reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and result in a faster job runtime."
