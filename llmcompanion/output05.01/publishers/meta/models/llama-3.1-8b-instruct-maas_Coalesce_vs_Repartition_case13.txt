      "operation": "repartitioned_df = sales_df.repartition(10)  # Inefficient partitioning",
      "improvementExplanation": "The purpose of using repartition() in this context is to change the number of partitions in the DataFrame. However, this operation requires a full shuffle, which can be inefficient for large datasets. In this case, the number of partitions is being reduced from the default value to 10, which is not necessary for filtering the data.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "repartitioned_df = sales_df.coalesce(10)",
      "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() can reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and result in a faster job runtime. This is because coalesce() reduces the number of partitions without requiring a full shuffle, which can be more efficient for certain operations."
