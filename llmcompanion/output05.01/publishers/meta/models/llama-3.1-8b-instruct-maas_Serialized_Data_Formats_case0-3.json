            "improvementExplanation": "The current data format is a list, which is not an optimized format for large-scale data processing. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can improve performance by reducing the time it takes to read and write data. Parquet and ORC are columnar storage formats that are optimized for query performance and can provide faster reads and writes compared to CSV or JSON.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "You can use the `spark.read.parquet()` method to read a Parquet file and create a Spark DataFrame. For example:\nspark.read.parquet(\"data.parquet\").show()\nAlternatively, you can use the `spark.read.json()` method to read a JSON file and create a Spark DataFrame.",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC can provide faster reads and writes, compression, and query optimization through predicate pushdown."
