            "operation": "Reading a text file using textFile() at line 9: file_q3 = spark.sparkContext.textFile(input_file)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The current data format is text, which is not optimized for performance. Switching to Parquet or ORC can improve performance by reducing the time it takes to read and write data. Parquet and ORC are columnar storage formats that are designed to handle large datasets efficiently. They provide features like compression, predicate pushdown, and query optimization, which can significantly improve the performance of data processing tasks.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "You can replace the textFile() operation with a read operation using Parquet format. Here's an example of how to do it:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nfrom pyspark.sql import functions as F\n\n# Create an instance of a SparkSession object\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"Quiz 3\").getOrCreate()\n\n# Read a Parquet file\nparquet_q3 = spark.read.parquet(input_file)\nparquet_q3.show()\n```\n\nThis will read the Parquet file and display the contents.",

            "operation": "Collecting data using collect() at line 11: file_q3.collect() and line 15: flat_q3.collect()",
            "improvementExplanation": "Collecting data using collect() can be expensive in terms of performance, especially for large datasets. This is because it involves transferring data from the cluster to the driver node, which can lead to network congestion and slow down the processing time. Switching to a more efficient data format like Parquet or ORC can reduce the need for collecting data and improve performance.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "You can replace the collect() operation with a more efficient approach, such as using the count() method or the show() method to display the first few rows of the data. Here's an example of how to do it:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\n# Create an instance of a SparkSession object\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"Quiz 3\").getOrCreate()\n\n# Read a Parquet file\nparquet_q3 = spark.read.parquet(input_file)\nparquet_q3.count()\nparquet_q3.show(10)\n```\n\nThis will display the count of rows in the Parquet file and the first 10 rows of the data.",

            "operation": "Writing output to the console using print() at line 28: print(finalrdd)",
            "improvementExplanation": "Writing output to the console using print() can be slow and inefficient, especially for large datasets. This is because it involves serializing the data and writing it to the console, which can lead to performance issues. Switching to a more efficient data format like Parquet or ORC can reduce the need for writing output to the console and improve performance.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "You can replace the print() operation with a more efficient approach, such as writing the data to a Parquet file or a database. Here's an example of how to do it:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nfrom pyspark.sql import functions as F\n\n# Create an instance of a SparkSession object\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"Quiz 3\").getOrCreate()\n\n# Read a Parquet file\nparquet_q3 = spark.read.parquet(input_file)\n\n# Write the data to a Parquet file\nparquet_q3.write.parquet(\"output.parquet\")\n```\n\nThis will write the Parquet file to a new file called \"output.parquet\".",
