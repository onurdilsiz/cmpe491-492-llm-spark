            "operation": "repartitioned_df = error_logs_df.repartition(10)  # Inefficiently increases partitions",
            "improvementExplanation": "The purpose of using repartition() in this context is to increase the number of partitions to 10. However, this operation requires a full shuffle, which can be inefficient. A more efficient approach would be to use coalesce() to reduce the number of partitions, which does not require a full shuffle.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "repartitioned_df = error_logs_df.coalesce(10)",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() reduces shuffling, improves resource usage, and results in faster job runtime."
