            "improvementExplanation": "The map operation is used to create a new DataFrame from the result of the executeRestApi UDF. However, this operation can be improved by using the DataFrame's built-in functions to create the new DataFrame, which can lead to better performance and scalability.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "You can use the DataFrame's select and explode functions to achieve the same result without using the map operation. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nrequest_df = request_df.select(explode(col('execute.Results')).alias('results'))\nrequest_df = request_df.select(col('results.Make_ID'), col('results.Make_Name'))\n```",
            "benefits": "Using the DataFrame's built-in functions can lead to better performance, scalability, and resource usage. It can also reduce the amount of data that needs to be shuffled, which can improve the overall efficiency of the job."
