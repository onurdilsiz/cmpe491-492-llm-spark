      "improvementExplanation": "The purpose of using repartition() in this context is to redistribute the data into 10 partitions for processing. However, since the data is being processed in a foreachPartition() operation, which already operates on a partitioned dataset, coalesce() can be used instead to reduce the number of partitions without incurring a full shuffle.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "forms = spark.textFile('hdfs:///user/carrdp/FinanceML/13F/Q12015/links10.txt') \\\n        .coalesce(10) \\\n        .foreachPartition(getForm)",
      "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() reduces shuffling, improves resource usage, and results in faster job runtime because it only reduces the number of partitions without redistributing the data."
