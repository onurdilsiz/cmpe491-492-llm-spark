      "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used to redistribute the data across the cluster, which can lead to a full shuffle. However, in this case, the data is already in a partitioned state, and the repartition() operation is not necessary. Instead, coalesce() can be used to reduce the number of partitions, which can lead to improved resource usage and faster runtime.",

      "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() can reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and lead to faster runtime."
