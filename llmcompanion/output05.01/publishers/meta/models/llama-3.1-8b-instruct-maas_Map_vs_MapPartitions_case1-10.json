            "improvementExplanation": "The map() transformation is used to apply the getForm() function to each link in the links10.txt file. However, the getForm() function performs I/O-heavy operations (downloading files and writing to disk) and is not a simple mapping operation. This makes it a good candidate for replacement with mapPartitions(), which can process the links in batches and reduce the number of function calls.",

            "benefits": [
                "Reduced function call overhead: By processing the links in batches, mapPartitions() reduces the number of function calls, which can improve performance.",
                "Optimized I/O: mapPartitions() can optimize I/O operations by processing the links in batches, which can reduce the number of disk accesses.",
                "Improved resource utilization: By processing the links in batches, mapPartitions() can improve resource utilization by reducing the number of threads and memory allocations."
