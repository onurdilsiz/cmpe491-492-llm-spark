      "improvementExplanation": "The map() operation is used in a user-defined function (udf) to calculate the differences between consecutive elements in the array. This operation can be performed at the partition level, as it involves iterating over the elements of the array. By using mapPartitions(), we can take advantage of the partition-level parallelism and reduce the function call overhead.",

@udf(ArrayType(DoubleType()))
def delta_mol(array):
    def calculate_differences(array):
        differenze = [(array[i+1] / array[i] -1)*100 if array[i] != 0.0 else 0.0 for i in range(len(array)-1) ]
        return differenze
    return array.mapPartitions(calculate_differences).collect()
