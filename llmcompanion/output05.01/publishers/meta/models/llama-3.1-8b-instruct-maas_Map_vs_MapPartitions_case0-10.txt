This operation can be performed at the partition level, as it involves batching and processing a large number of strings. By using mapPartitions(), we can reduce the function call overhead and optimize I/O operations. mapPartitions() will apply the lambda function to each partition of the RDD, rather than individual elements, resulting in improved performance.",
