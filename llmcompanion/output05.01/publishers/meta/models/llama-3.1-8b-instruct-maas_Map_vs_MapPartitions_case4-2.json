            "operation": "map() is used in the line where the 'bonus' column is created: df.withColumn('bonus', when(df.gender == 'f', 1000).otherwise(500))",
            "improvementExplanation": "The map() transformation is used to create a new column 'bonus' based on the condition of the 'gender' column. However, this operation can be performed at the partition level, as it involves batching or I/O-heavy operations. By using mapPartitions(), we can take advantage of the partition-level processing to improve performance.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "You can replace the map() operation with mapPartitions() as follows:\n```python\ndef create_bonus_partition(rdd):\n  return rdd.map(lambda row: (row.gender, 1000 if row.gender == 'f' else 500))\n\nbonus_rdd = df.rdd.mapPartitions(create_bonus_partition)\nbonus_df = bonus_rdd.toDF()\ndf = df.withColumn('bonus', bonus_df)\n```\nThis code snippet demonstrates how to create the 'bonus' column using mapPartitions(), which can lead to improved performance for partition-level operations.",
