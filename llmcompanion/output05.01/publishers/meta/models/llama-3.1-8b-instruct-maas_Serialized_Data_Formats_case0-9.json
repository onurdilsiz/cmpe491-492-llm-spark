            "improvementExplanation": "The current data format is a text file, which can be slow for large datasets. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can improve performance by reducing the time it takes to read and write data. Parquet and ORC are columnar storage formats that are optimized for querying and can provide faster reads and writes compared to text files.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "You can replace the text file read operation with a Parquet file read operation using the following code:\n\nrdd = spark.read.parquet(\"/apps/sparkbyexamples/src/pyspark-examples/data.parquet\")",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC can provide faster reads and writes, compression, and query optimization through predicate pushdown."
