      "improvementExplanation": "The purpose of using repartition() in this context is to change the number of partitions in the DataFrame. However, this operation requires a full shuffle, which can be inefficient. In this case, the number of partitions is being reduced from the default value to 10, which is not necessary if the number of partitions is already sufficient for the job.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "repartitioned_df = transactions_df.coalesce(10)",
      "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() can reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and result in a faster job runtime. This is because coalesce() reduces the number of partitions by moving data from extra partitions to the existing ones, whereas repartition() requires a full shuffle to redistribute the data."
