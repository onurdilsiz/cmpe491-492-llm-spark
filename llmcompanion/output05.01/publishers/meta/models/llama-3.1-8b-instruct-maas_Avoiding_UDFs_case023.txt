      "improvementExplanation": "The UDF is used to parse the text file into a structured format. However, this can be replaced with a more efficient approach using Spark's built-in `split` function or the `from_json` function if the text file is in JSON format. Additionally, using `map` on an RDD is not the most efficient way to process data in Spark, as it can lead to data shuffling and serialization overhead.",

However, this can be replaced with a more efficient approach using Spark's built-in `withColumn` function or the `udf` function with a lambda expression.
