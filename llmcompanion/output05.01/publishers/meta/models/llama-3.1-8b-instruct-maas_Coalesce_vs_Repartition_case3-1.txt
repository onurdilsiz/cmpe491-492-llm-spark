      "improvementExplanation": "The repartition operation is used to redistribute the data across the cluster. However, in this case, it's used to reduce the number of partitions from the default value to a specified number. This can be achieved more efficiently using coalesce, which reduces the number of partitions without triggering a full shuffle.",
