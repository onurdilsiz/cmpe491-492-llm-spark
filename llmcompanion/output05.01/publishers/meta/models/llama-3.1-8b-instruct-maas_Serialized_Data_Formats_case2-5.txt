      "improvementExplanation": "The current data format is XML, which is not optimized for Spark's performance. Switching to Parquet or ORC format can improve performance by reducing the time it takes to read and write data. Parquet and ORC are columnar storage formats that are designed to work well with Spark's data processing engine.",
