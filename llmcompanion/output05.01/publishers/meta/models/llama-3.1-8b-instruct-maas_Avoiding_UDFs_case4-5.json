            "improvementExplanation": "The UDF is used to create a new Page.skeleton with synthetic entity linking and paragraph list. However, this operation can be replaced with a native DataFrame/Dataset operation using the `map` function or a `withColumn` transformation with a lambda function. This would enable Catalyst optimizations and improve performance.",
