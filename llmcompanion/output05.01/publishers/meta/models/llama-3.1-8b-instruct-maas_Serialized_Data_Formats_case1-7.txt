      "operation": "Reading data from a CSV-like format (not explicitly specified) and writing the result to a CSV-like format (not explicitly specified) in the `custom_repartitioner` function.",
      "location": "The entire `custom_repartitioner` function is responsible for reading and writing data, but the specific lines are not explicitly specified in the code. However, the function is designed to handle small files issues in Spark, which implies that it is working with data stored in a file system.",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current data format is not explicitly specified, but it is likely a CSV-like format. Switching to an optimized serialized format like Parquet or ORC can improve performance by reducing the time it takes to read and write data. Parquet and ORC are columnar storage formats that are optimized for querying and can provide faster reads and writes compared to CSV-like formats. Additionally, they support compression, which can reduce storage costs and improve data transfer times.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "To replace the current operation with one using an optimized serialized format like Parquet, you can use the `spark.read.parquet` and `spark.write.parquet` methods. For example:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\nspark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()\n\n# Read data from a Parquet file\nparquet_df = spark.read.parquet('path/to/parquet/file')\n\n# Write the result to a Parquet file\nresult_df = custom_repartitioner(parquet_df, max_records_in_each_file, distribution_keys)\nresult_df.write.parquet('path/to/output/file')\n\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can use the `spark.read.orc` and `spark.write.orc` methods to work with ORC files.",
      "benefits": "Switching to an optimized serialized format like Parquet or ORC can provide the following benefits:\n\n* Faster reads and writes\n* Compression, which can reduce storage costs and improve data transfer times\n* Query optimization through predicate pushdown"
