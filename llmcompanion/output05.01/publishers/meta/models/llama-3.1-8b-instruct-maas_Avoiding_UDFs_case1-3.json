            "improvementExplanation": "The UDF operation 'substr' can be replaced with the built-in function 'substr' from the 'pyspark.sql.functions' module. However, in this case, it's more efficient to use the 'substring' method directly on the DataFrame column 'value'. This is because the 'substring' method is optimized for Catalyst and can take advantage of the DataFrame's internal representation.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "df1.withColumn('Weather_Station', df1['value'].substring(5, 6))",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with the 'substring' method can improve performance by enabling Catalyst optimizations and reducing serialization overhead."
