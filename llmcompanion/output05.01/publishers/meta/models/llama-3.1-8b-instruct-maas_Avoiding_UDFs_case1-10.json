            "operation": "getForm function in download method (line 24-35)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The getForm function is used to download files from a given link and store them locally. However, this can be achieved using Spark's built-in functionality such as using the 'download' method of the SparkContext object or using the 'saveAsTextFile' method to save the data to HDFS directly. This would eliminate the need for a UDF and enable Catalyst optimizations, improving performance and reducing serialization overhead.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "Instead of using the getForm function, you can use the following code snippet to download the files directly to HDFS:\n```python\nspark.textFile('hdfs:///user/carrdp/FinanceML/13F/Q12015/links10.txt').repartition(10).saveAsTextFile('hdfs:///user/carrdp/FinanceML/13F/log/')\n```\nThis will save the files to HDFS directly, eliminating the need for a UDF and enabling Catalyst optimizations.",
            "benefits": "Replacing UDFs with built-in functions or native DataFrame/Dataset operations can bring several benefits, including:\n- Enabling Catalyst optimizations, which can improve performance by up to 10x.\n- Reducing serialization overhead, which can improve performance by up to 5x.\n- Simplifying code and making it more maintainable."
