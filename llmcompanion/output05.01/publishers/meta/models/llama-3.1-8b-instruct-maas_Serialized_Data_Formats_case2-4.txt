      "improvementExplanation": "The current data format is CSV, which is a text-based format. Switching to Parquet or ORC, which are columnar storage formats, can improve performance by reducing the time it takes to read and write data. Parquet and ORC are optimized for fast data processing and provide features like compression and predicate pushdown, which can significantly improve query performance.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "You can use the `spark.read.parquet()` function to read Parquet files instead of CSV. Here's an example:\n\n`lines = sc.textFile(sys.argv[1], 1).map(lambda x: x.split(','))` becomes `lines = spark.read.parquet(sys.argv[1]).select('column_name')`",
