      "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used to redistribute the data across the cluster. However, in this case, it's not necessary because the data is already being processed in a single operation. The withColumn() method is used to add a new column to the DataFrame, which doesn't require a full shuffle.",

      "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() would reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and result in a faster job runtime."
