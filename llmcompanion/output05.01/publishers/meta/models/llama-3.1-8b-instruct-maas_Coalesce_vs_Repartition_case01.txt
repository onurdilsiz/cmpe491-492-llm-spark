      "improvementExplanation": "The purpose of using repartition() in this context is to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame. However, this operation requires a full shuffle, which can be inefficient, especially when the number of partitions is increased. In this case, coalesce() can be used instead to reduce the number of partitions, which would suffice for writing to an output.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "repartitioned_df = electronics_sales_df.coalesce(10)",
      "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() would reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and result in a faster job runtime."
