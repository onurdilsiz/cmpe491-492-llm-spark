            "improvementExplanation": "The current data format is a list of tuples, which is not an optimized format for large-scale data processing. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC would improve performance by reducing the overhead of reading and writing data in a non-optimized format.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "You can use the `spark.read.parquet()` method to read data from a Parquet file, or use the `spark.createDataFrame()` method with a Parquet file as the input. For example:\n\nspark.read.parquet('data.parquet').show()\n\nor\n\ndf = spark.createDataFrame(spark.read.parquet('data.parquet'), ['chiave', 'array_col'])",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC would provide faster reads and writes, compression, and query optimization through predicate pushdown."
