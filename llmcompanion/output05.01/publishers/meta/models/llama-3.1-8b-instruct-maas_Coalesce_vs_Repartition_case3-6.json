            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used to change the number of partitions in the DataFrame. However, in this case, it's used to save the result to a file, which doesn't require a full shuffle. A coalesce() operation can be used instead to reduce the number of partitions, which will lead to reduced shuffling and improved resource usage.",

            "benefits": "Reduced shuffling, improved resource usage, and faster runtime."
