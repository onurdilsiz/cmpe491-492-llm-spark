            "improvementExplanation": "The purpose of using repartition() in this context is to redistribute the data into a larger number of partitions. However, this operation requires a full shuffle, which can be inefficient. In this case, reducing the number of partitions from the default value to 10 is unnecessary, as the default value is likely chosen to balance the load across the available resources. Reducing the number of partitions can lead to increased memory usage and slower job runtime due to the additional shuffling.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "sales_df.coalesce(10)",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() can reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and result in faster job runtime. Coalesce() reduces the number of partitions without requiring a full shuffle, making it more efficient for reducing partitions."
