            "improvementExplanation": "The Imputer's fit and transform operations are performed on the entire DataFrame. This can be optimized by using mapPartitions(), which allows for parallel processing of the data at the partition level. This can lead to improved performance, especially for large datasets.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "imputer.fit(df_pyspark.rdd.mapPartitions(lambda x: [row for row in x])).transform(df_pyspark.rdd.mapPartitions(lambda x: [row for row in x])).show()",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() can reduce function call overhead, optimize I/O operations, and improve resource utilization by processing data in parallel at the partition level."
