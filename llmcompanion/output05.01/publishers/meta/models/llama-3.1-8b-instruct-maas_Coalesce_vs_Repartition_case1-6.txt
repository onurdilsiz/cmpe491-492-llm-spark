      "improvementExplanation": "The repartition operation is used to redistribute the data across the cluster, which can lead to a full shuffle. However, in this case, the data is being written to a single file, and the number of partitions is being set to 200. This can be achieved more efficiently using coalesce, which reduces the number of partitions without a full shuffle.",

      "benefits": "Switching to coalesce can reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and result in a faster job runtime."
