      "improvementExplanation": "The map() transformation is used to process each partition of the uri_rdd. However, the process_partition function is I/O-heavy as it involves accessing S3 objects and parsing WARC files. This operation can be performed at the partition level, making mapPartitions() a suitable replacement. By using mapPartitions(), the function will be applied to each partition of the RDD, reducing the number of function calls and improving performance.",
