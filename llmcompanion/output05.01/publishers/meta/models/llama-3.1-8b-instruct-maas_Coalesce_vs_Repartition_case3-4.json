            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used to partition the data by year and month. However, since the data is already partitioned by year and month, a full shuffle is not necessary. Instead, coalesce() can be used to reduce the number of partitions, which will improve resource usage and reduce shuffling.",

            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() will reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and result in a faster runtime."
