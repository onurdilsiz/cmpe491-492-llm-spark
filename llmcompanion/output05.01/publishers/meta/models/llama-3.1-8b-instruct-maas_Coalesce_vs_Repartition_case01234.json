            "improvementExplanation": "The purpose of using repartition() in this context is to change the number of partitions in the DataFrame. However, this operation requires a full shuffle, which can be inefficient. In this case, the number of partitions is being increased from 5 to 10, which is not necessary. A coalesce() operation would be more suitable to reduce the number of partitions, which would reduce shuffling and improve resource usage.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df.coalesce(10)",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() would reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and result in a faster job runtime."
