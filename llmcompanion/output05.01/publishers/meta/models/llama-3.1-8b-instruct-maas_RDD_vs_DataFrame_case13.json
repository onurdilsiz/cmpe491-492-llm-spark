            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is causing a full shuffle, which can be inefficient. This is because repartition() always re-partitions the data, whereas coalesce() tries to minimize the number of partitions.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "Use coalesce() instead of repartition() to minimize the number of partitions. This can be done by replacing the line `repartitioned_df = sales_df.repartition(10)` with `repartitioned_df = sales_df.coalesce(10)`. However, note that coalesce() will throw an error if you try to coalesce to a number of partitions that is less than the current number of partitions.",
