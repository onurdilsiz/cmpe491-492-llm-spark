      "improvementExplanation": "The purpose of using repartition() in this context is to set the initial number of partitions for the data. However, this operation requires a full shuffle, which can be avoided by using coalesce() instead. coalesce() reduces the number of partitions without shuffling the data, making it more efficient for this use case.",

      "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() reduces shuffling, improves resource usage, and results in faster job runtime."
