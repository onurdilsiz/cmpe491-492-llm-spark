            "improvementExplanation": "The current data format is Delta, which is a columnar storage format optimized for fast reads and writes. However, it can be further optimized by switching to Parquet or ORC, which are more widely supported and offer better compression and query optimization. Parquet and ORC are also more efficient for large-scale data processing and can reduce the storage requirements.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "spark.read.format(\"parquet\").load(f\"{absolute_dir_path}/imputed_results\")",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC can provide faster reads and writes, better compression, and improved query optimization through predicate pushdown. This can lead to significant performance improvements, especially for large-scale data processing."
