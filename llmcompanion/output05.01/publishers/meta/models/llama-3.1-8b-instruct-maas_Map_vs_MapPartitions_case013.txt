      "improvementExplanation": "The map() transformation is used to parse each line in the transactions_rdd into a list. However, this operation can be performed at the partition level, as it involves batching and processing a large number of lines together. By using mapPartitions(), we can reduce the function call overhead and optimize I/O operations.",
