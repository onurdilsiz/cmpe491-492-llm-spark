      "improvementExplanation": "The process_warcs method is used to process WARC records. This method is I/O-heavy as it involves downloading files from S3 and processing them. Using mapPartitions() instead of map() can improve performance by reducing the number of function calls and optimizing I/O operations. mapPartitions() allows the processing of each partition in parallel, which can lead to significant speedups for I/O-heavy operations.",
