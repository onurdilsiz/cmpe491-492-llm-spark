      "improvementExplanation": "The mapPartitions() transformation is already being used in this line to read the CSV file. However, the filter() operation is applied after the mapPartitions(). If the filter() operation is I/O-heavy, it would be more efficient to apply it at the partition level using mapPartitions().",
