            "improvementExplanation": "The current data format is CSV, which is not optimized for large-scale data processing. Switching to Parquet or ORC format can improve performance by reducing the size of the data and enabling faster reads and writes. Additionally, Parquet and ORC formats support compression, which can further reduce the size of the data and improve performance.",

            "location": "write_to_parquet function, line 43",
            "improvementExplanation": "The current data format is Parquet, but the data is being written in chunks, which can lead to performance issues. Switching to a more efficient chunking strategy or using a different optimized format like ORC can improve performance. Additionally, using a more efficient compression algorithm can further reduce the size of the data and improve performance.",
