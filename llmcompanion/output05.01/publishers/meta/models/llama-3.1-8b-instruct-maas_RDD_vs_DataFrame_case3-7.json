            "improvementExplanation": "The usage of pandas' read_csv function to read the CSV file into a DataFrame can be replaced with Spark's read.csv function to read the CSV file directly into a DataFrame, which can be more efficient when dealing with large datasets.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "data = spark.read.csv(wine_path, header=True, inferSchema=True)",
            "benefits": "This change can improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred between the Spark cluster and the driver node, and also reduce the memory usage by reading the data directly into a DataFrame."
