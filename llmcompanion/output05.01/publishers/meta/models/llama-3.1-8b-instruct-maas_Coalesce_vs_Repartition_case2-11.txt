      "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used to redistribute the data across the cluster. However, in this case, the number of partitions is set to the number of distinct buckets, which is a fixed value. This means that the data is already evenly distributed, and a full shuffle is not necessary. Coalesce() can be used instead to reduce the number of partitions, which will lead to reduced shuffling and improved resource usage.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "uri_rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(distinct_buckets, numSlices=len(distinct_buckets)).coalesce(1)",
      "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() will reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and lead to faster job runtime."
