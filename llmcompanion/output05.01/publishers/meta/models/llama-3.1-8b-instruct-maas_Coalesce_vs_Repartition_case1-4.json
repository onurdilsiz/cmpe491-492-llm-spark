            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition operation is used to redistribute the data into 50 partitions before writing it to a CSV file. However, since the data is already filtered to 5 years, it is likely that the number of rows is significantly reduced. In this case, coalesce can be used instead of repartition to reduce the number of partitions to 50 without causing a full shuffle.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df_5years.coalesce(50).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").mode(\"overwrite\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000-2005/coalesce/50\")",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() can reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and result in a faster job runtime. This is because coalesce() reduces the number of partitions in-place, without causing a full shuffle, which can be expensive in terms of resources and time."
