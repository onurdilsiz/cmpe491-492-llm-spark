      "improvementExplanation": "The map() transformation is used to apply the is_number function to each partition of the flat_q3 RDD. However, the is_number function is designed to process each element in the iterator, which is a characteristic of mapPartitions(). By using mapPartitions(), we can take advantage of the fact that the function is already designed to process each element in the iterator, resulting in reduced function call overhead and optimized I/O. Additionally, mapPartitions() is more efficient when dealing with large datasets, as it avoids the overhead of creating a new RDD for each partition.",
