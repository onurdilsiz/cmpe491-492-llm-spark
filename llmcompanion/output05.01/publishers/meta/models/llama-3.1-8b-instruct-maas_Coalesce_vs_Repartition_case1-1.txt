      "improvementExplanation": "The repartition operation is used to redistribute the data across the cluster, which can lead to a full shuffle. However, in this case, the data is being written to a file, and the number of partitions is being reduced from the default to 50. This can be achieved more efficiently using coalesce, which reduces the number of partitions without triggering a full shuffle.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "df2.coalesce(50).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/coalesce/50\")",
      "benefits": [
        "Reduced shuffling, which can lead to faster job runtime",
        "Improved resource usage, as the number of partitions is reduced",
        "Faster runtime, as the data is written in a more efficient manner"
