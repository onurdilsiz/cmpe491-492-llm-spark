      "improvementExplanation": "Delta format is a good choice for storing and managing large datasets, but it may not be the most efficient format for reading data into Spark. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve read performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.",

      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC will provide the following benefits:\n* **Faster read performance:** Parquet and ORC are columnar formats that allow Spark to read only the columns it needs, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed.\n* **Compression:** Parquet and ORC support compression, which can significantly reduce the size of the data on disk and improve read times.\n* **Query optimization:** Parquet and ORC support predicate pushdown, which allows Spark to push filters down to the storage layer, further improving query performance."
