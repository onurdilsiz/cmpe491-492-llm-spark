    {
      "operation": "repartitioned_df = sales_df.repartition(10)  # Inefficient partitioning",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame to 10. However, this is unnecessary as the DataFrame already has a sufficient number of partitions for the subsequent filtering operation. Using `coalesce()` instead would avoid a full shuffle and improve efficiency.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "coalesced_df = sales_df.coalesce(10)",
      "benefits": "Replacing `repartition()` with `coalesce()` in this case would:\n- Reduce shuffling, as `coalesce()` only moves data within existing partitions.\n- Improve resource usage, as it avoids unnecessary data movement.\n- Potentially lead to faster job runtime due to reduced shuffling."
