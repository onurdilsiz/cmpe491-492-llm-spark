      "operation": "rdd.mapPartitions(worker.train).collect() in `_train` method of `SparkModel` class",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `mapPartitions` operation with a custom `worker.train` function is essentially a UDF. While `mapPartitions` itself is a Spark transformation, the custom logic within `worker.train` is not optimized by Catalyst. This can be improved by using Spark's built-in functions or DataFrame/Dataset operations if the logic within `worker.train` can be expressed using them. In this specific case, the `worker.train` function performs model training using Keras, which is not directly replaceable by Spark's built-in functions. However, the data preparation part (converting iterator to numpy arrays) can be done using Spark's native operations if the input RDD is converted to a DataFrame.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "This specific UDF cannot be directly replaced with a single Spark built-in function because it involves model training. However, if the input RDD is converted to a DataFrame, the data preparation part can be done using Spark's native operations. For example, if the input RDD is of the form `(features, labels)`, it can be converted to a DataFrame with columns `features` and `labels`. Then, the data can be accessed using DataFrame operations. However, the model training part will still require a UDF or a custom implementation using Spark's MLlib.",
      "benefits": "Replacing UDFs with built-in functions or DataFrame/Dataset operations enables Catalyst optimizations, which can significantly improve performance. It also reduces serialization overhead, as Spark doesn't need to serialize and deserialize the custom function for each partition. However, in this specific case, the core logic of model training cannot be replaced by Spark's built-in functions."

      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the synchronous case, the `mapPartitions` operation with a custom `worker.train` function in the asynchronous case is also a UDF. The same limitations apply here. The model training logic within `worker.train` cannot be directly replaced by Spark's built-in functions.
