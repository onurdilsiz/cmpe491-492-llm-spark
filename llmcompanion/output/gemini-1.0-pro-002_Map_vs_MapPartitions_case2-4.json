            "improvementExplanation": "The `map()` operation on line 13 applies the `check_prem_typ_desc()` function to each element of the RDD. This function appears to be I/O-heavy, as it reads data from the 16th column of each record. By using `mapPartitions()`, we can process the data in batches, reducing the number of I/O operations and improving performance.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\nresults = lines.mapPartitions(lambda partition: map(lambda x: check_prem_typ_desc(x[16]), partition))\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to `mapPartitions()` offers several benefits:\n* **Reduced function call overhead:** By processing data in batches, we avoid the overhead of calling the `check_prem_typ_desc()` function for each individual element.\n* **Optimized I/O:** Reading data in batches can improve I/O efficiency, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n* **Improved resource utilization:** Processing data in parallel within partitions can lead to better resource utilization and faster execution times."
