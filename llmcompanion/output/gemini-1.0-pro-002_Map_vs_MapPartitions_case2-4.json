            "improvementExplanation": "The `map()` operation is applied to each element of the `lines` RDD. This involves calling the `check_prem_typ_desc()` function for each element, which may be inefficient if the function is computationally expensive or involves I/O operations. By using `mapPartitions()`, we can process elements in batches within each partition, potentially reducing function call overhead and optimizing I/O.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\nresults = lines.mapPartitions(lambda partition: map(lambda x: check_prem_typ_desc(x[16]), partition))\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to `mapPartitions()` can provide the following benefits:\n- **Reduced function call overhead:** By processing elements in batches, we can reduce the number of times the `check_prem_typ_desc()` function is called.\n- **Optimized I/O:** If the `check_prem_typ_desc()` function involves I/O operations, processing elements in batches can improve I/O efficiency.\n- **Improved resource utilization:** By processing elements in parallel within each partition, we can improve resource utilization."
