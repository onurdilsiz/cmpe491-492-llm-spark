## Explanation

The provided code snippet does not contain any RDD operations. It only defines functions and UDFs using Python and Spark SQL. Therefore, there are no opportunities to replace RDDs with DataFrames/Datasets for performance improvement. 

The code snippet utilizes UDFs for data manipulation and transformation. UDFs can be used with both RDDs and DataFrames/Datasets. While DataFrames/Datasets offer performance advantages in many scenarios, they are not directly applicable in this case due to the absence of RDD operations.
