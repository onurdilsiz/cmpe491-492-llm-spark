      "operation": "Reading data from a text file using `spark.sparkContext.textFile()` (line 10)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a text file, which is not an optimized format for Spark. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve performance due to:\n\n* **Faster reads/writes:** Serialized formats are optimized for reading and writing large datasets efficiently.\n* **Compression:** Serialized formats compress data, reducing storage space and network transfer time.\n* **Query optimization:** Serialized formats support predicate pushdown, allowing Spark to filter data before reading it, further improving performance.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read data from a Parquet file\nfile_q3 = spark.read.parquet(input_file)\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC will provide the following benefits:\n\n* **Faster data processing:** Reading and writing data will be significantly faster.\n* **Reduced storage space:** Data will be compressed, reducing storage requirements.\n* **Improved query performance:** Predicate pushdown will allow Spark to filter data before reading it, further improving query performance."
