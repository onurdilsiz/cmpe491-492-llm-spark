      "operation": "Line 61: df = df.repartition(number_of_files, '_salted_key')",
      "improvementExplanation": "The repartition operation performs a full shuffle, which can be expensive.  Since the goal is to increase the number of partitions, not necessarily redistribute data perfectly randomly, coalesce is a better choice if the existing number of partitions is less than `number_of_files`.  If the existing number of partitions is already greater than or equal to `number_of_files`, then repartition is unnecessary and can be removed entirely.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "if df.rdd.getNumPartitions() < number_of_files:\n    df = df.coalesce(number_of_files)\nelse:\n    df = df.drop('_salted_key')",
      "benefits": "Reduced shuffling, improved resource usage, and faster job runtime.  Avoids unnecessary shuffling if the number of partitions is already sufficient."

    {
      "operation": "The code does not explicitly specify an input format, but it's likely reading from a CSV or other non-optimized format given the context of handling small files.",
      "improvementExplanation": "Reading from CSV is inefficient for large datasets.  Parquet, ORC, or Avro offer significant performance improvements due to columnar storage, compression, and schema enforcement.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "Instead of reading from CSV, use:\ndf = spark.read.parquet('path/to/parquet/data')\n# or\ndf = spark.read.orc('path/to/orc/data')\n# or\ndf = spark.read.avro('path/to/avro/data')",
