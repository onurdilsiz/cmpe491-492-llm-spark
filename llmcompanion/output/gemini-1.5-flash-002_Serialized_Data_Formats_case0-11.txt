      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a CSV file, which is a text-based format.  CSV lacks built-in compression and schema enforcement, leading to slower read times and increased storage costs.  Switching to Parquet or ORC provides significant performance improvements due to columnar storage, compression, and schema enforcement.  Parquet and ORC support predicate pushdown, enabling Spark to filter data before reading it entirely, further enhancing performance.",

      "benefits": "Faster read speeds, reduced storage space due to compression, improved query performance through predicate pushdown, and schema enforcement for data integrity."

      "improvementExplanation": "The code saves the results to a text file, which is inefficient for large datasets.  Parquet or ORC offer significant advantages in terms of write speed and storage efficiency.  The columnar storage format allows for faster writes and smaller file sizes compared to row-oriented text formats.",
