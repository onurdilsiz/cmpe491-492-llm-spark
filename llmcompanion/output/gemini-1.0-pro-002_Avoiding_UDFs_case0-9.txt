**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of User-Defined Functions (UDFs). All the operations are performed using Spark's built-in functions and native DataFrame/Dataset transformations.

**Benefits of Avoiding UDFs:**

* **Catalyst Optimizations:** Spark's Catalyst optimizer can effectively optimize built-in functions and native DataFrame/Dataset operations, resulting in improved query performance.
* **Performance:** Built-in functions and native operations are generally more efficient than UDFs, as they are implemented in Scala and compiled to native code.
* **Serialization Overhead:** UDFs require serialization and deserialization, which can introduce overhead, especially when dealing with large datasets.

**Conclusion:**

The provided Spark code effectively utilizes Spark's built-in functions and native DataFrame/Dataset operations, avoiding the potential drawbacks of UDFs. This approach enables Catalyst optimizations, improves performance, and reduces serialization overhead.
