      "improvementExplanation": "The UDFs used to extract 'oil_value' and 'fuel_liters' from the 'details' column can be replaced with a more efficient approach using pandas' `json_normalize` function. This avoids the overhead of applying a lambda function row by row.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "from pandas.io.json import json_normalize\ndf = pd.read_csv('/Users/mac/Downloads/predictive.csv')\ndf['details'] = df['details'].apply(lambda x: json.loads(x.replace(\"'\", \"\\\"\")))\ndf = json_normalize(df['details'])\ndf = pd.concat([df, df['details'].apply(pd.Series)], axis=1)",
      "benefits": "Replacing the UDFs with `json_normalize` improves performance by vectorizing the operation, eliminating the need for row-by-row processing. This leads to faster execution and reduced overhead."

      "operation": "lines 30-31: df['day_of_week'] = df['date_insertion'].dt.dayofweek\ndf['hour_of_day'] = df['date_insertion'].dt.hour",
      "improvementExplanation": "These operations extract the day of the week and hour of the day from the 'date_insertion' column.  Pandas' built-in datetime accessors already provide this functionality efficiently. No UDF is needed.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "The existing code is already optimal and doesn't require a UDF.  No changes are needed.",
      "benefits": "The existing code is efficient. Using built-in functions avoids the overhead of UDFs, leading to better performance."
