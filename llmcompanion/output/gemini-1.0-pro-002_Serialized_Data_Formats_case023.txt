    {
      "operation": "Reading data from a text file (line 6)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a text file using `spark.sparkContext.textFile()`. This is an inefficient way to read data into Spark, especially when dealing with large datasets. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance due to columnar storage, compression, and optimized file formats.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read data from Parquet file\norders_df = spark.read.parquet(\"path/to/orders.parquet\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Reading data from Parquet or ORC files is significantly faster than reading from text files. These formats offer columnar storage, compression, and optimized file formats, leading to faster data loading and processing."
    },
    {
      "operation": "Saving data in CSV format (line 21)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code saves data in CSV format using `taxed_orders_df.write.format(\"csv\")`. While CSV is a common format, it is not optimized for Spark processing. Switching to Parquet or ORC would provide significant performance benefits due to their optimized structure and compression capabilities.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Save data in Parquet format\ntaxed_orders_df.write.parquet(\"path/to/taxed_orders_output.parquet\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Saving data in Parquet or ORC formats offers significant performance advantages. These formats are optimized for Spark processing, providing faster write speeds, smaller file sizes due to compression, and improved query performance through predicate pushdown."
    },
    {
      "operation": "Using map() instead of mapPartitions() (line 14)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code uses `map()` to apply a transformation to each order. While `map()` is convenient, it can be inefficient for large datasets. Using `mapPartitions()` would process data in partitions, improving performance and reducing data shuffling.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Apply transformation using mapPartitions()\ntaxed_orders_rdd = electronics_orders_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: [(order[0], order[1], float(order[2]) * 1.1, order[3]) for order in partition])\n```",
      "benefits": "Using `mapPartitions()` instead of `map()` improves performance by processing data in partitions, reducing data shuffling, and optimizing resource utilization."
