**Explanation:**

The provided code does not use any RDDs. It exclusively utilizes DataFrames and Spark SQL for data processing and analysis. Therefore, there are no opportunities to replace RDDs with DataFrames/Datasets for performance improvement.

**Benefits of Using DataFrames/Datasets:**

While this specific code example does not demonstrate the advantages of DataFrames/Datasets over RDDs, it's essential to understand the benefits they offer in general:

- **Performance:** DataFrames/Datasets leverage Spark SQL's Catalyst Optimizer, which enables efficient query planning and execution. This often leads to faster processing compared to RDDs, especially for complex data transformations.
- **Scalability:** DataFrames/Datasets are designed to handle large datasets efficiently, making them suitable for big data applications. They can seamlessly scale across multiple nodes in a Spark cluster.
- **Resource Usage:** DataFrames/Datasets optimize memory usage by storing data in a columnar format. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be shuffled during operations, leading to better resource utilization.
- **Ease of Use:** DataFrames/Datasets provide a more intuitive and user-friendly API compared to RDDs. They offer a rich set of operations for data manipulation, making it easier to write concise and readable code.

**Conclusion:**

The provided code effectively utilizes DataFrames/Datasets for data analysis, maximizing performance and scalability. There are no RDD operations to replace, and the code already leverages the benefits of DataFrames/Datasets.
