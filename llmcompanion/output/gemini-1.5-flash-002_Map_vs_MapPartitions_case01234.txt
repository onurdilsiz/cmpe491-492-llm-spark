Since the operation involves string splitting and type conversion for each element, it's not inherently partition-level. However, if the data were significantly larger, the overhead of repeatedly calling the lambda function for each element could be substantial.  mapPartitions would allow processing multiple lines within a partition at once, reducing the function call overhead.",
