            "improvementExplanation": "Reading data from a CSV file using `urllib2.urlopen` can be inefficient, especially for large datasets. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be read and processed.",

            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC will provide the following benefits:\n* **Faster reads/writes:** Parquet and ORC are columnar formats that store data in a compressed and efficient manner, resulting in faster reads and writes compared to CSV.\n* **Compression:** Parquet and ORC use compression techniques to reduce the size of the data on disk, saving storage space and improving network transfer times.\n* **Query optimization:** Parquet and ORC support predicate pushdown, which allows Spark to filter data at the file level before reading it, further improving query performance."
