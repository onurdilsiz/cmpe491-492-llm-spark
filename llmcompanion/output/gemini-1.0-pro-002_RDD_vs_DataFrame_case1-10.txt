      "benefits": "Using a DataFrame/Dataset with `foreach` instead of `foreachPartition` allows for:

* **Reduced shuffling:** DataFrames/Datasets can perform operations like filtering and aggregation within partitions, minimizing the need to shuffle data across the network.
* **Query optimization:** DataFrames/Datasets leverage Spark SQL's query optimizer, which can choose the most efficient execution plan based on the data and operations involved.
* **Better resource utilization:** DataFrames/Datasets can efficiently handle data serialization and deserialization, reducing the overhead associated with RDDs.
