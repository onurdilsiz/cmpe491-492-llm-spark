      "improvementExplanation": "The map() operation on 'skeleton' at line 104 iterates over each PageSkeleton object in the list. This operation involves creating a new PageSkeleton object for each element, which can be computationally expensive. By using mapPartitions(), we can process the 'skeleton' list in partitions, reducing the number of function calls and improving performance.",

      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() in this case can provide the following benefits:\n\n* **Reduced function call overhead:** By processing the 'skeleton' list in partitions, we reduce the number of function calls required to create new PageSkeleton objects.\n* **Optimized I/O:** mapPartitions() allows for more efficient I/O operations, as data can be processed in larger chunks.\n* **Improved resource utilization:** By reducing the number of function calls and optimizing I/O, mapPartitions() can improve the overall resource utilization of the Spark job."
