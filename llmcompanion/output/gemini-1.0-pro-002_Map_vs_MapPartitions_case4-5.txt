      "improvementExplanation": "The `synthetic_page_skeleton_and_paragraphs_udf` function processes each page bytearray independently. This makes it suitable for parallel execution using `mapPartitions()`. By applying the function to partitions of data instead of individual elements, we can reduce function call overhead and improve I/O efficiency.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf\n\n@pandas_udf(\"binary\")\ndef synthetic_page_skeleton_and_paragraphs_udf_pandas(iterator):\n    \"\"\"PySpark udf creating a new Page.skeleton with synthetic entity linking + paragraph list\"\"\"\n\n    # ... (function implementation remains the same)\n\n\ndef process_partition(iterator):\n    for page_bytearray in iterator:\n        yield synthetic_page_skeleton_and_paragraphs_udf_pandas([page_bytearray])\n\ndf = df.rdd.mapPartitions(process_partition).toDF()\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to `mapPartitions()` in this case offers several benefits:\n\n* **Reduced function call overhead:** By applying the function to partitions instead of individual elements, we can significantly reduce the number of function calls, leading to improved performance.\n* **Optimized I/O:** `mapPartitions()` allows for efficient data processing within each partition, minimizing data shuffling and improving I/O performance.\n* **Improved resource utilization:** By processing data in parallel across partitions, `mapPartitions()` can better utilize available resources, leading to faster execution times."
