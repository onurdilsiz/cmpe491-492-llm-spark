            "improvementExplanation": "These map operations apply a simple transformation to each element.  This transformation is independent across elements and doesn't require inter-element communication or complex operations.  Therefore, it's suitable for mapPartitions, which processes data in batches within each partition, reducing the overhead of repeatedly calling the function for each element.",

            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions reduces the function call overhead significantly, as the function is called once per partition instead of once per element. This leads to improved performance, especially for large datasets."

            "operation": "predictions = model.predict(test_samples.map(lambda x: x.features))",
            "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the previous case, this map operation applies a simple transformation (extracting features) to each element.  The transformation is independent and can be efficiently performed within each partition using mapPartitions.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "predictions = model.predict(test_samples.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: (x.features for x in iterator)))",
            "benefits": "Reduces function call overhead, leading to faster execution.  The performance gain is more pronounced for larger datasets and partitions."

        {
            "operation": "labels_and_preds = test_samples.map(lambda x: x.label).zip(predictions)",
            "improvementExplanation": "This map operation extracts labels from the test samples.  While seemingly simple, it still involves a function call for each element.  mapPartitions can process multiple elements at once within a partition, reducing the overhead.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "labels_and_preds = test_samples.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: (x.label for x in iterator)).zip(predictions)",
            "benefits": "Reduces function call overhead.  The performance improvement might be less significant compared to the previous cases, but it still contributes to overall efficiency, especially when dealing with a large number of test samples."
