**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of User-Defined Functions (UDFs). Therefore, there are no UDFs to analyze or replace.

**Benefits of Avoiding UDFs:**

While UDFs can be useful in certain scenarios, they can also have performance implications. Replacing UDFs with built-in functions or native DataFrame/Dataset operations can provide several benefits:

- **Catalyst Optimizations:** Spark's Catalyst optimizer can effectively optimize built-in functions and native operations, resulting in improved query performance.
- **Performance Improvement:** Built-in functions and native operations are often more efficient than UDFs, as they are implemented in Scala or Java and can leverage Spark's internal optimizations.
- **Reduced Serialization Overhead:** UDFs require serialization and deserialization, which can add overhead to data processing. Avoiding UDFs can reduce this overhead and improve performance.
