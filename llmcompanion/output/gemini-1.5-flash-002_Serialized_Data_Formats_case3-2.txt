      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a CSV file, which is a text-based format.  CSV files are not optimized for Spark's distributed processing.  They lack built-in compression and schema enforcement, leading to slower read times and increased storage costs. Switching to Parquet or ORC provides significant performance gains due to their columnar storage, compression, and schema enforcement.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nparquet_path = \"file:///root/data_team_2.parquet\"\ndf = spark.read.parquet(parquet_path)\n#If the file doesn't exist, you'll need to convert from CSV first:\n#df.write.parquet(parquet_path)\n```",
      "benefits": "Faster read speeds, reduced storage costs due to compression, improved query performance through predicate pushdown and efficient columnar data access."

      "operation": "Writing data to CSV files in 'file:///root/filtered_data_team_2_clean/' at lines 72-76: `filtered_df.write \\n        .mode('default') \\n        .option(\"header\", \"false\") \\n        .csv(output_path)`",
      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the input operation, writing to CSV is inefficient.  The output is written as multiple small CSV files, increasing the I/O overhead. Parquet or ORC would write a smaller number of larger, compressed files, significantly improving write performance and reducing storage space.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nparquet_output_path = \"file:///root/filtered_data_team_2_clean.parquet\"\nfiltered_df.write.mode('overwrite').parquet(parquet_output_path)\n```",
      "benefits": "Faster write speeds, reduced storage space due to compression, and improved data loading times for subsequent processing."
