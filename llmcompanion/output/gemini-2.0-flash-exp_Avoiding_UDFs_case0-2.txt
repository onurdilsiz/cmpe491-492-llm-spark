      "improvementExplanation": "The lambda function `lambda email: email.split(' ')` is used to split each email string into words. This can be replaced with the built-in `split` function directly within the `flatMap` operation. While this is a simple operation, avoiding the lambda can sometimes improve readability and potentially reduce overhead.",

While there isn't a direct built-in function to replace this specific creation, it's a standard operation within the MLlib library and doesn't represent a typical UDF that would hinder Spark's optimizations. It's a necessary step for preparing data for MLlib models.",
