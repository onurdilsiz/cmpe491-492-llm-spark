            "operation": "map() operation on line 14",
            "improvementExplanation": "The map() operation on line 14 can be replaced with mapPartitions() because it involves a batching operation (creating a list from an RDD). mapPartitions() is more efficient for batching operations as it processes data in partitions, reducing function call overhead and improving I/O efficiency.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\n# Replace map() with mapPartitions()\nlistRdd = listRdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: [item for item in partition])\n```",
            "benefits": "Replacing map() with mapPartitions() in this case will:\n- Reduce function call overhead by processing data in partitions.\n- Optimize I/O by reading and writing data in larger chunks.\n- Improve resource utilization by reducing the number of tasks."
