      "operation": "Reading the dataset in CSV format (line 10)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current CSV format is not optimized for Spark processing. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve performance due to:\n\n* **Faster reads/writes:** Serialized formats store data in a columnar format, allowing Spark to efficiently read and write only the required columns, reducing I/O overhead.\n* **Compression:** Serialized formats compress data, reducing storage space and network transfer times.\n* **Query optimization:** Serialized formats support predicate pushdown, enabling Spark to filter data at the storage layer, further reducing processing time.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read the dataset in Parquet format\ndf_pyspark = spark.read.parquet(\"test2.parquet\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC will provide:\n\n* **Faster data processing:** Reduced I/O overhead, compression, and predicate pushdown lead to faster data processing.\n* **Reduced storage space:** Compression reduces storage requirements.\n* **Improved query performance:** Predicate pushdown enables faster filtering and data retrieval."
