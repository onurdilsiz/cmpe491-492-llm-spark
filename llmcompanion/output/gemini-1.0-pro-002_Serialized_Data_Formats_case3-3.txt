      "operation": "Reading the dataset from a CSV file (line 10)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current CSV format is not optimized for Spark processing. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve performance due to faster reads/writes, compression, and query optimization through predicate pushdown.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read the dataset from a Parquet file\ndf_pyspark = spark.read.parquet(\"test2.parquet\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC will provide the following benefits:\n* **Faster reads/writes:** Serialized formats like Parquet and ORC are optimized for Spark processing, resulting in faster data loading and saving times.\n* **Compression:** These formats compress data efficiently, reducing storage space requirements and network transfer times.\n* **Query optimization:** Parquet and ORC support predicate pushdown, which allows Spark to filter data at the file level, further improving query performance."
