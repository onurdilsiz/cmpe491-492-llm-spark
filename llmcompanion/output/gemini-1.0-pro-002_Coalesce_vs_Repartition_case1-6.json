            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame to 200. However, since the subsequent operation is writing the DataFrame to a CSV file, which does not require a specific number of partitions, we can use `coalesce()` instead. `coalesce()` will reduce the number of partitions to the minimum required for the output format, which is likely to be much smaller than 200. This will reduce the amount of data shuffling and improve the overall performance of the job.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df_5years.coalesce(1).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").mode(\"overwrite\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000-2005/repartition/200\")",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` will provide the following benefits:\n* **Reduced shuffling:** By reducing the number of partitions, we can significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be shuffled across the cluster, which can improve the overall performance of the job.\n* **Improved resource usage:** With fewer partitions, we can utilize the cluster resources more efficiently, as each partition will have more data to process.\n* **Faster runtime:** The reduced shuffling and improved resource usage will likely lead to a faster overall runtime for the job."
