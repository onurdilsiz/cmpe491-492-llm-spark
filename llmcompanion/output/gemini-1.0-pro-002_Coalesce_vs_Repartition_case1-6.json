            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame to 200. This is done before writing the DataFrame to a CSV file. However, since the DataFrame is already being written to a distributed file system (HDFS), the data is already partitioned across multiple nodes. Therefore, using `coalesce()` instead of `repartition()` would be more efficient. `coalesce()` will simply reduce the number of partitions to the desired number (200 in this case) without shuffling the data, which can significantly improve performance.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df_5years.coalesce(200).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").mode(\"overwrite\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000-2005/repartition/200\")",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` in this case will provide the following benefits:\n* **Reduced shuffling:** Since the data is already distributed across multiple nodes, `coalesce()` will not need to shuffle the data, which can significantly improve performance.\n* **Improved resource usage:** By reducing the number of partitions, `coalesce()` can help to reduce the amount of memory and CPU resources used by the job.\n* **Faster runtime:** The reduced shuffling and improved resource usage can lead to a faster overall runtime for the job."
