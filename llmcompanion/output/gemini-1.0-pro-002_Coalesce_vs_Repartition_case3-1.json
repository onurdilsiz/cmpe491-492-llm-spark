            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition(1000)` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame. However, since the subsequent operation `coalesce(100)` reduces the number of partitions again, it would be more efficient to use `coalesce(100)` directly. This would avoid the unnecessary shuffle caused by `repartition(1000)`. Replacing `repartition(1000)` with `coalesce(100)` would reduce the amount of data shuffled and improve the overall performance of the job.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df_train = df_train.coalesce(100)",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce(100)` would:\n- Reduce the amount of data shuffled, leading to faster job execution.\n- Improve resource utilization by avoiding unnecessary data movement.\n- Simplify the code by removing the redundant `repartition()` operation."
