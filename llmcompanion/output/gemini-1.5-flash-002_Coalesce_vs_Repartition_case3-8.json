            "operation": "Line 68: `weightsRDD = spark_context.parallelize(weights)`",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `parallelize` operation creates an RDD with the number of partitions equal to the number of cores in your Spark cluster.  Since `weights` is a small NumPy array, there's no need for a large number of partitions.  Repartitioning later is unnecessary and causes a full shuffle. Using `coalesce` avoids this unnecessary shuffle.",

            "benefits": "Reduced shuffling, improved resource usage, faster runtime."

            "operation": "Line 69: `dataRDD = spark_context.parallelize(data)`",
            "improvementExplanation": "Similar to `weightsRDD`, `dataRDD` is created from a relatively small NumPy array. Repartitioning later is inefficient. `coalesce` to a smaller number of partitions (or even 1) will avoid unnecessary shuffling.",

            "improvementExplanation": "The `pos_hidden_states` array is created after operations within the driver. Parallelizing and then immediately converting to a `BlockMatrix` leads to unnecessary overhead.  `coalesce` can reduce the number of partitions before creating the `BlockMatrix`.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "pos_hidden_states = as_block_matrix(spark_context.parallelize(pos_hidden_states).coalesce(1))",

            "operation": "Line 85: `pos_hidden_probs = as_block_matrix(spark_context.parallelize(pos_hidden_probs))`",
            "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the previous case, `pos_hidden_probs` is created in the driver. Parallelizing and converting to a `BlockMatrix` without considering partition numbers is inefficient. `coalesce` can optimize this.",

            "improvementExplanation": "Again, `neg_visible_probs` is generated in the driver.  Unnecessary parallelization and repartitioning occur. Using `coalesce` avoids the full shuffle.",

            "improvementExplanation": "Similar to previous cases, `neg_hidden_probs` is created in the driver.  The `parallelize` and subsequent `BlockMatrix` conversion cause unnecessary overhead. `coalesce` is a more efficient alternative.",

            "improvementExplanation": "The weights array is updated in the driver.  Parallelizing and creating a `BlockMatrix` without considering the optimal number of partitions is inefficient. `coalesce` can prevent unnecessary shuffling.",

        {
            "operation": "Line 51:  `pos_hidden_activations = dataBlockMatrix.multiply(weightsBlockMatrix)`",
            "improvementExplanation": "While not explicitly a `repartition()` call, the `multiply` operation on `BlockMatrix` objects might trigger implicit repartitioning depending on the block sizes and data distribution. If the number of partitions is already optimal, using `coalesce` after this operation might be beneficial if further operations don't require a large number of partitions.  This requires careful analysis of the data and subsequent operations.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "This requires more context and analysis of the data and subsequent operations to determine the optimal number of partitions for coalesce.  A potential solution (if further operations don't require many partitions) could be: `pos_hidden_activations = dataBlockMatrix.multiply(weightsBlockMatrix).blocks.mapPartitions(lambda x: ...).coalesce(1)` (replace `...` with the necessary transformation).",
