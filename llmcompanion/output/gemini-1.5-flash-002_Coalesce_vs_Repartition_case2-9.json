            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition(numPartitions=L)` operation is used to redistribute the data across `L` partitions.  If the initial number of partitions in `sc.textFile(data_path)` is greater than or equal to `L`, a full shuffle is unnecessary.  `coalesce` can reduce the number of partitions without shuffling if the target number of partitions is less than or equal to the current number. This avoids the significant overhead of a full data shuffle.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "rawData = sc.textFile(data_path).coalesce(L)",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce` will reduce or eliminate the shuffle operation if the initial number of partitions is greater than or equal to L. This leads to improved performance by reducing resource consumption (CPU, network, memory) and faster job runtime.  If the initial number of partitions is less than L, coalesce will still perform better than repartition in terms of resource usage and speed."
