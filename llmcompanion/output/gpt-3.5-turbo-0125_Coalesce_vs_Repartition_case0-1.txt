            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation here is used to evenly redistribute data across partitions for better parallelism. However, since the operation does not require a full shuffle and only aims to reduce the number of partitions, coalesce() can be more efficient.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "moviePairSimilarities = moviePairRatings.mapValues(computeCosineSimilarity).cache().coalesce(4)",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() reduces unnecessary shuffling, optimizes resource usage by minimizing data movement, and can lead to faster job execution."
