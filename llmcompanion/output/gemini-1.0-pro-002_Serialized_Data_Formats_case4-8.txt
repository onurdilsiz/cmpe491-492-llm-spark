**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any explicit input/output operations. It primarily focuses on defining user-defined functions (UDFs) for data manipulation and analysis. These UDFs are designed to operate on in-memory data structures within Spark, without directly reading or writing data from external sources.

Therefore, there are no opportunities to optimize input/output operations by switching to serialized data formats like Parquet or ORC. These formats are typically used for efficient storage and retrieval of large datasets on distributed file systems, but they are not relevant in the context of the provided code, which deals with in-memory data processing.
