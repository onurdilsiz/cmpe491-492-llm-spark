**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any explicit input/output operations. It primarily focuses on defining user-defined functions (UDFs) and helper functions for data manipulation. While these functions may indirectly interact with data sources or sinks, the specific input/output formats are not specified within the code itself.

Therefore, it is not possible to identify opportunities for optimization by switching to serialized data formats like Parquet or ORC without additional context about the data sources and sinks used in the broader application.

**Additional Considerations:**

* If you provide more information about the data sources and sinks used in the application, I can analyze the code further and identify potential areas for optimization.
* It's important to note that even if input/output operations are not explicitly defined within the code, they may still occur implicitly through Spark's internal data handling mechanisms. Analyzing the Spark application execution plan or profiling its performance can provide insights into the actual data formats being used and potential optimization opportunities.
