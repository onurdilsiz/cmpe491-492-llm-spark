            "operation": "The map() operation is used on line 22 to extract the 'Weather_Station' column from the 'value' column.",
            "improvementExplanation": "The map() operation on line 22 can be replaced with mapPartitions() because it involves extracting a single column from each record, which is a partition-level operation. Using mapPartitions() can reduce function call overhead and improve performance by processing data in batches.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\ndef extract_weather_station(partition):\n  for record in partition:\n    yield (record['value'].substr(5, 6),)\n\ndf2 = df1.rdd.mapPartitions(extract_weather_station).toDF(['Weather_Station'])\n```",
            "benefits": "Replacing map() with mapPartitions() in this case offers the following benefits:\n\n* **Reduced function call overhead:** mapPartitions() processes data in batches, reducing the number of function calls compared to map().\n* **Optimized I/O:** mapPartitions() can potentially improve I/O efficiency by reading and processing data in larger chunks.\n* **Improved resource utilization:** mapPartitions() can lead to better resource utilization by reducing the number of tasks and threads required for processing."
