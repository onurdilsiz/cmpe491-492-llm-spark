            "improvementExplanation": "This `repartition()` is used to redistribute the data across `self.num_workers` partitions before training.  If the current number of partitions is already greater than or equal to `self.num_workers`, a full shuffle is unnecessary. `coalesce()` can reduce the number of partitions without shuffling if the target number of partitions is less than or equal to the current number.",

            "benefits": "Using `coalesce()` with `shuffle=False` avoids a full data shuffle if the current number of partitions exceeds `self.num_workers`. This leads to reduced execution time and resource consumption."

            "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the previous case, this `repartition()` aims to redistribute data for training.  Unnecessary shuffling can occur if the initial partition count is already sufficient. Using `coalesce()` avoids this.",
