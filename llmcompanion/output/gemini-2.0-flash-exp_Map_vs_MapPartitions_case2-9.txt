    {
      "operation": "cells_counts.map(region_counts7)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `region_counts7` function iterates through a 7x7 grid of cells, accessing the `cells_counts_dict` for each cell. This operation can be performed more efficiently at the partition level. Instead of calling `region_counts7` for each cell in the RDD, we can iterate through the cells within a partition and perform the lookup in `cells_counts_dict` once per partition, reducing the overhead of function calls and potentially improving data locality.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "cells_counts.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: [region_counts7(cell_count) for cell_count in iterator])",
      "benefits": "Reduced function call overhead, improved data locality by performing lookups within a partition, and potentially better performance due to batch processing."
    },
    {
      "operation": "cells_counts.map(region_counts3)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the previous case, the `region_counts3` function iterates through a 3x3 grid of cells, accessing the `cells_counts_dict`. This operation can also be optimized by performing it at the partition level. By iterating through the cells within a partition and performing the lookups in `cells_counts_dict` once per partition, we can reduce the overhead of function calls and improve data locality.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "cells_counts.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: [region_counts3(cell_count) for cell_count in iterator])",

    },
    {
      "operation": "P.map(lambda point: min(math.dist(point, center) for center in broadcast_C.value))",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `map` operation calculates the minimum distance from each point to all centers in the broadcast variable `broadcast_C`. This calculation can be performed more efficiently at the partition level. By iterating through the points within a partition, we can reduce the overhead of function calls and potentially improve data locality. The broadcast variable is accessed once per partition instead of once per point.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "P.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: [min(math.dist(point, center) for center in broadcast_C.value) for point in iterator])",
      "benefits": "Reduced function call overhead, improved data locality by accessing the broadcast variable once per partition, and potentially better performance due to batch processing."
