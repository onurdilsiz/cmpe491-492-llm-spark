            "operation": "Reading movie names from \"ml-100k/u.ITEM\" file using a text-based format in `loadMovieNames` function (lines 6-11).",
            "improvementExplanation": "The current implementation reads movie names from a text file, likely in a simple format like CSV or delimited text.  This can be slow, especially for large datasets.  Switching to a columnar storage format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance. These formats offer better compression and enable efficient data access by only reading the necessary columns, unlike row-oriented formats that require reading the entire row even if only a single column is needed.  Furthermore, Parquet and ORC support predicate pushdown, allowing Spark to filter data before reading it from disk, further enhancing performance.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"MovieSimilarities\").getOrCreate()\n\nmovieNamesDF = spark.read.parquet(\"movie_names.parquet\")\nnameDict = movieNamesDF.rdd.map(lambda row: (row.movieID, row.movieName)).collectAsMap()\n```\n\n**Note:** This requires pre-processing the \"ml-100k/u.ITEM\" file into a Parquet file named \"movie_names.parquet\" using a tool like `pandas` and Spark's `to_parquet` function.",
            "benefits": "Faster reads due to columnar storage and compression.  Predicate pushdown enables filtering data before reading, reducing I/O. Improved overall performance, especially for large datasets."

            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads movie ratings from a text file, likely in a delimited format.  Similar to the movie names, this operation can be significantly optimized by using Parquet or ORC.  These formats provide better compression and enable faster reads, especially when dealing with large datasets.  The columnar storage allows Spark to read only the necessary columns, improving query performance.",

The schema needs to be defined appropriately (e.g., userID: integer, movieID: integer, rating: float).",
