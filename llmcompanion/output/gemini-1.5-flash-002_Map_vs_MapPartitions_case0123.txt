      "operation": "parsed_logs_rdd = log_rdd.map(lambda line: line.split(','))",
      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation splits each line of the log file.  This is an I/O-bound operation, and processing it within each partition using mapPartitions would reduce the overhead of repeatedly calling the function for each line.  mapPartitions allows for batch processing of lines within a partition, leading to efficiency gains.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "parsed_logs_rdd = log_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: (line.split(',') for line in iterator))",
      "benefits": "Reduced function call overhead by processing multiple lines within a partition at once. Improved I/O efficiency by reading and processing lines in batches."
    },
    {
      "operation": "timestamps_rdd = error_logs_rdd.map(lambda log: log[0])",
      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation extracts the timestamp from each log entry.  While not inherently I/O-bound, the overhead of calling the lambda function for each element can be significant. mapPartitions can process multiple log entries within a partition at once, reducing the function call overhead.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "timestamps_rdd = error_logs_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: (log[0] for log in iterator))",
      "benefits": "Reduced function call overhead by processing multiple log entries within a partition at once. Improved performance by reducing the number of function calls."
