            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` function is used to increase the number of partitions in the RDD. However, in this case, the `coalesce()` function can be used instead to reduce the number of partitions. This is because the `coalesce()` function does not shuffle the data, which can improve the performance of the job.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "```python\n# Replace repartition() with coalesce()\njoined = joined.coalesce(numPartitions)\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` can provide the following benefits:\n* Reduced shuffling: `coalesce()` does not shuffle the data, which can significantly improve the performance of the job.\n* Improved resource usage: `coalesce()` can reduce the memory usage of the job by reducing the number of partitions.\n* Faster runtime: `coalesce()` can lead to a faster runtime by reducing the amount of time spent shuffling data."
