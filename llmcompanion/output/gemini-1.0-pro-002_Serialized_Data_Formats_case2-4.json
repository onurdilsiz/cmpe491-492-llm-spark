            "operation": "Reading CSV file (line 12)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The current code reads data from a CSV file using `sc.textFile`. This format is not optimized for Spark processing, leading to slower read times and increased memory usage. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve performance due to their columnar storage, compression, and optimized read/write operations.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\nspark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()\ndf = spark.read.parquet(\"input_data.parquet\")\n# Further processing on the DataFrame\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC offers several benefits:\n- **Faster reads/writes:** Columnar storage allows for efficient data access and reduces the amount of data scanned.\n- **Compression:** Data is compressed, reducing storage requirements and network transfer times.\n- **Query optimization:** Predicate pushdown allows filtering data at the file level, further improving query performance."

            "improvementExplanation": "The current code writes the results to a text file using `results.saveAsTextFile`. This format is not ideal for storing large datasets and can be inefficient for subsequent processing. Using Parquet or ORC for both input and output provides a consistent, optimized format throughout the pipeline.",

            "benefits": "Using Parquet or ORC for output provides the same benefits as mentioned above for input data: faster reads/writes, compression, and query optimization."
