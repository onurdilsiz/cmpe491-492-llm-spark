            "operation": "Parsing the RDD into structured format (transaction_id, customer_id, amount, category) using map() on line 10.",
            "improvementExplanation": "The map() operation on line 10 splits each line of the RDD into a list of values. This operation can be performed more efficiently using mapPartitions() because it processes data in batches, reducing the number of function calls and improving I/O performance.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\nparsed_transactions_rdd = transactions_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: (line.split(',') for line in partition))\n```",
            "benefits": "Replacing map() with mapPartitions() in this case will:\n- Reduce function call overhead by processing data in batches.\n- Optimize I/O by reading and processing data in larger chunks.\n- Improve overall performance by utilizing resources more efficiently."
