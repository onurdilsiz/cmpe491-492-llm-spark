## Analysis

The provided Spark code does not use any RDDs. It exclusively utilizes DataFrames for data processing. Therefore, there are no opportunities to replace RDDs with DataFrames for improved performance.

## Explanation

The code demonstrates efficient data manipulation using DataFrames, leveraging their optimized query execution engine and ability to handle complex transformations without the need for manual RDD management. This approach offers several advantages:

* **Simplified development:** DataFrames provide a more intuitive and concise API for data manipulation compared to RDDs.
* **Improved performance:** DataFrames benefit from Spark's Catalyst Optimizer, which generates efficient execution plans for complex queries.
* **Reduced code complexity:** DataFrames eliminate the need for manual RDD transformations and actions, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.
* **Better resource utilization:** DataFrames efficiently utilize cluster resources by avoiding unnecessary data shuffling and serialization.

## Conclusion

The provided Spark code effectively leverages DataFrames for data analysis, demonstrating best practices for efficient and scalable data processing.
