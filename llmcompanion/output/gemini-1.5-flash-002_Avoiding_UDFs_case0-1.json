            "operation": "def loadMovieNames(): ... (lines 5-11)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `loadMovieNames` function reads a file into a dictionary. This can be replaced by a Spark broadcast variable for efficiency.  Broadcasting avoids redundant file reads on each executor.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "movieNames = sc.broadcast(dict((int(line.split('|')[0]), line.split('|')[1].decode('ascii', 'ignore')) for line in sc.textFile(\"file:///SparkCourse/ml-100k/u.ITEM\").collect()))",
            "benefits": "Using broadcast variables avoids redundant I/O operations across the cluster, improving performance and reducing network traffic.  It also allows for better data locality."
        },
        {
            "operation": "def makePairs((user, ratings)): ... (lines 13-16)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `makePairs` UDF transforms a tuple into another tuple. This can be achieved using `select` and column manipulation within the DataFrame API.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "joinedRatings.selectExpr(\"ratings._1 as movie1\", \"ratings._2 as rating1\", \"ratings1._1 as movie2\", \"ratings1._2 as rating2\").select(F.struct(F.col(\"movie1\"), F.col(\"movie2\")).alias(\"moviePair\"), F.struct(F.col(\"rating1\"), F.col(\"rating2\")).alias(\"ratingPair\"))",
            "benefits": "Using the DataFrame API enables Catalyst optimizations, leading to improved performance and execution plans. It also avoids the overhead of UDF serialization and deserialization."

        {
            "operation": "def filterDuplicates( (userID, ratings) ): ... (lines 18-21)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `filterDuplicates` UDF filters pairs based on movie IDs. This can be done using a filter condition within the DataFrame API.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "joinedRatings.filter(\"ratings._1 < ratings1._1\")",
            "benefits": "Using DataFrame's built-in filter operation allows Catalyst to optimize the filtering process, resulting in better performance. It avoids the overhead associated with UDFs."
        },
        {
            "operation": "def computeCosineSimilarity(ratingPairs): ... (lines 23-40)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `computeCosineSimilarity` UDF calculates cosine similarity. While a direct replacement with a single built-in function isn't available, Spark's MLlib library provides efficient methods for calculating similarity metrics.  For this specific case, a custom aggregation function within the DataFrame API might be more efficient than a UDF.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "A more complex solution involving several DataFrame operations and potentially using a custom aggregation function would be needed here.  A full implementation is beyond the scope of this response, but it would involve grouping by movie pairs, calculating sums of squares and cross-products using aggregate functions, and then computing the cosine similarity.",
            "benefits": "Using Spark's MLlib or custom aggregation functions within the DataFrame API allows for optimized execution plans and parallel processing, leading to significant performance improvements compared to UDFs.  It also avoids the overhead of UDF serialization and deserialization."
