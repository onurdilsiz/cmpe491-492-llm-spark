            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used here to distribute the data across a specified number of partitions (`number_of_files`) based on the `_salted_key`. The goal is to achieve a more even distribution of data across partitions after the initial grouping and joining operations. However, since the number of partitions is being reduced from the previous stage, `coalesce()` can be used instead of `repartition()`. `coalesce()` avoids a full shuffle, which is more efficient when reducing the number of partitions. `repartition()` always performs a full shuffle, even if the number of partitions is reduced. In this case, we are reducing the number of partitions from the previous stage, so `coalesce()` is more efficient.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df = df.coalesce(number_of_files)\n            .drop('_salted_key')",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` will reduce the amount of data shuffling, as it avoids a full shuffle. This will lead to improved resource usage, as less data needs to be moved across the network. Consequently, the job runtime will be faster due to reduced shuffling and data movement."
