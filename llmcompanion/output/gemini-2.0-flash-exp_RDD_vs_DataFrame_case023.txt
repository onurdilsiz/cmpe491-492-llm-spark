      "improvementExplanation": "Reading data as a text file and then parsing it using `map` is inefficient. DataFrames can directly read structured data from files, inferring the schema and optimizing the parsing process.",

      "benefits": "DataFrames provide schema inference, which avoids manual parsing and type conversions. They also leverage Catalyst optimizer for query optimization, leading to faster data loading and processing. Reading directly into a DataFrame is more efficient than reading as text and then parsing."

      "dataframeEquivalent": "electronics_orders_df = orders_df.filter(orders_df[\"category\"] == \"Electronics\")",
      "benefits": "DataFrames use the Catalyst optimizer to optimize filter operations, potentially reducing the amount of data scanned and processed. This leads to faster execution and better resource utilization."
