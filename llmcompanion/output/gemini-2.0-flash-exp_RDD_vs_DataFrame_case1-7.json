            "rddOperation": "max(int(partition._num) for partition in agg_df.collect())",
            "improvementExplanation": "The code uses `agg_df.collect()` to bring all the data to the driver and then iterates through it to find the maximum value. This is inefficient because it moves all the data to the driver, which can cause memory issues and slow down the process, especially with large datasets. This operation can be performed more efficiently using DataFrame aggregation.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\nnumber_of_files = agg_df.agg(F.max('_num')).collect()[0][0]\n```",
            "benefits": "By using `agg(F.max('_num'))`, the maximum value is computed in a distributed manner across the cluster, avoiding the need to collect all the data to the driver. This reduces the load on the driver, improves performance, and allows the code to scale better with larger datasets. The `collect()[0][0]` is used to extract the single value from the result."
