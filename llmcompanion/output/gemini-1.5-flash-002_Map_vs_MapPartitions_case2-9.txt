    {
      "operation": "Line 118: inputPoints = rawData.map(lambda line: [float(i) for i in line.split(',')])",
      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation converts each line of the input file (a string) into a list of floats. This operation is performed independently on each element and doesn't require interaction between elements within a partition.  Therefore, switching to mapPartitions would not provide significant performance benefits. The overhead of creating and managing iterators might even outweigh any potential gains.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "No significant improvement expected.  Keeping as map().",

    {
      "operation": "Line 86: outlierCells = cells_counts.map(region_counts7).filter(lambda x: x[1] <= M).collectAsMap()",
      "improvementExplanation": "The map operation applies `region_counts7` to each (cell, count) pair.  `region_counts7` accesses `cells_counts_dict`, which is a dictionary created from the entire RDD.  This means each call to `region_counts7` needs access to the entire RDD's data.  mapPartitions would not be beneficial here because the operation requires global information (cells_counts_dict).",

      "operation": "Line 87: uncertainCells = cells_counts.map(region_counts3).filter(lambda x: x[1] <= M and x[0] not in outlierCells).collectAsMap()",
      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the previous map operation, this one applies `region_counts3`, which also accesses the globally-created `cells_counts_dict`.  The operation requires access to the entire RDD's data, making mapPartitions unsuitable. The overhead of creating and managing iterators might even outweigh any potential gains.",

      "operation": "Line 137: FarthestPoint = P.map(lambda point: min(math.dist(point, center) for center in broadcast_C.value)).reduce(max)",
      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation calculates the minimum distance from each point to the nearest center.  The operation is independent for each point and doesn't require interaction between points within a partition. Switching to mapPartitions might offer a slight performance improvement by reducing the overhead of function calls, but the benefit might be marginal compared to the overhead of iterator management.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "P.mapPartitions(lambda partition: [min(math.dist(point, center) for center in broadcast_C.value) for point in partition]).reduce(max)",
      "benefits": "Potential for slight performance improvement due to reduced function call overhead. However, the benefit might be marginal and needs empirical testing to confirm."
