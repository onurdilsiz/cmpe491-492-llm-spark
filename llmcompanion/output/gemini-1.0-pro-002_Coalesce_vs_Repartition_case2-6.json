            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition(100)` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame. However, since the operation does not involve a shuffle, using `coalesce(100)` instead would achieve the same result without incurring the overhead of shuffling data across the cluster.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df.coalesce(100)",
            "benefits": "Replacing `repartition(100)` with `coalesce(100)` will:\n- Eliminate unnecessary shuffling, leading to faster execution.\n- Reduce resource consumption by avoiding data movement across the cluster.\n- Improve overall job performance."
