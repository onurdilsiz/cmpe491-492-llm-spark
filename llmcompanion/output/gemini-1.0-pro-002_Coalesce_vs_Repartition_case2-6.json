            "improvementExplanation": "In this case, repartition() is used to increase the number of partitions in the data_rdd. However, since the subsequent operation (get_input) is a mapPartitions, which preserves the number of partitions, the repartition() operation is unnecessary. Replacing it with coalesce() will achieve the same result without incurring the overhead of a full shuffle.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "data_rdd = data_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda row: get_input(row)).coalesce(numPartitions)",
            "benefits": "Replacing repartition() with coalesce() in this case will result in the following benefits:\n- Reduced shuffling: Coalesce() avoids the full shuffle required by repartition(), leading to improved performance.\n- Improved resource usage: Coalesce() consumes fewer resources compared to repartition(), as it does not involve data movement across the cluster.\n- Faster runtime: By eliminating the unnecessary shuffle, coalesce() can significantly improve the overall runtime of the job."
