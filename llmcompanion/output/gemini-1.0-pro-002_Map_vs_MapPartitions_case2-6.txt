      "operation": "map(lambda x: get_valid_items(x))",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `map()` operation is used to process each item in the RDD individually. This can lead to high function call overhead, especially when dealing with large datasets. Replacing `map()` with `mapPartitions()` allows us to process data in batches, reducing the number of function calls and improving performance.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "mapPartitions(lambda iter: get_valid_items(iter))",
      "benefits": "Switching to `mapPartitions()` offers several benefits:\n\n* **Reduced function call overhead:** By processing data in batches, we significantly reduce the number of function calls, leading to improved performance.\n* **Optimized I/O:** `mapPartitions()` allows for more efficient I/O operations, as data can be read and processed in larger chunks.\n* **Improved resource utilization:** By reducing function call overhead and optimizing I/O, `mapPartitions()` can lead to better resource utilization."
