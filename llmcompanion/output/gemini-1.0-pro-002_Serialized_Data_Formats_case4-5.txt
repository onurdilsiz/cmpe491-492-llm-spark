      "operation": "Reading data from a CBOR file using iter_pages() function (line 44)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The CBOR format is not optimized for efficient data processing in Spark. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance due to their columnar storage and compression capabilities.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\ndf = spark.read.parquet(read_path)\n```",
      "benefits": "Reading Parquet or ORC files is significantly faster than reading CBOR files due to columnar storage and compression. This can lead to faster processing times and improved performance."

      "operation": "Writing data to Parquet files using write_file_from_DataFrame() function (line 14)",
      "improvementExplanation": "While writing to Parquet is an improvement over CBOR, using ORC can provide further benefits in terms of compression and query optimization. ORC supports predicate pushdown, which allows Spark to filter data at the file level, further improving performance.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\ndf.write.orc(path + '_' + str(time.time()))\n```",
      "benefits": "Writing to ORC files offers additional benefits over Parquet, including better compression and support for predicate pushdown. This can lead to smaller file sizes and faster query execution."
