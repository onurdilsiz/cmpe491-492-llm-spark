            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a CSV file.  CSV is a text-based format, leading to slower read times and larger file sizes compared to binary formats like Parquet or ORC.  Switching to Parquet or ORC will significantly improve read performance due to its columnar storage and efficient compression.",

            "improvementExplanation": "The code writes data to a CSV file.
