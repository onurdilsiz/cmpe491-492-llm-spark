      "operation": "repartitioned_df = error_logs_df.repartition(10)  # Inefficiently increases partitions",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame. However, in this case, the DataFrame is being written to a CSV file, which does not require a specific number of partitions. Using `coalesce()` instead would reduce the number of partitions, potentially improving performance by reducing the amount of data shuffled during the write operation.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "coalesced_df = error_logs_df.coalesce(1)",
      "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` would reduce the amount of data shuffled during the write operation, potentially leading to faster job runtime and improved resource usage."
