      "improvementExplanation": "The sc.textFile operation creates an RDD.  This can be replaced by using Spark's DataFrame reader to directly read the data from the input path, leveraging Spark's optimized data processing capabilities.  The specific reader will depend on the input format (e.g., CSV, Parquet).",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "input_data = spark.read.text(self.args.input).repartition(self.args.num_input_partitions)",
      "benefits": "Improved performance due to optimized data processing, reduced shuffling, and easier integration with structured data formats."

      "improvementExplanation": "The process_warcs function acts as a UDF.  While mapPartitionsWithIndex is necessary for partition-level processing, the internal logic of process_warcs could potentially be optimized.  If possible, the logic should be expressed using Spark SQL functions or native DataFrame operations.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "A complete rewrite of the process_warcs function is needed to replace the UDF with Spark SQL functions or native DataFrame operations. This would require a detailed analysis of the function's logic and a restructuring of the data processing pipeline.",
