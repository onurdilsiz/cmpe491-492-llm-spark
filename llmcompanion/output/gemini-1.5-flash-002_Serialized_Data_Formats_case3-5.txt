      "operation": "Reading stations data from 'BDA/input/stations.csv' using CSV format (line 71)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads station data from a CSV file. CSV is a text-based format, leading to slower read times and higher storage costs compared to binary formats like Parquet or ORC.  Parquet and ORC offer better compression, columnar storage for faster query processing, and support for predicate pushdown, significantly improving performance, especially for large datasets.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "stations = sc.read.parquet(\"BDA/input/stations.parquet\")\nstations = stations.selectExpr(\"CAST(station_id AS STRING) station_id\", \"CAST(latitude AS FLOAT) latitude\", \"CAST(longitude AS FLOAT) longitude\")\nstations = stations.map(lambda x: (x.station_id,(x.latitude,x.longitude)))",
      "benefits": "Faster read speeds, reduced storage space, improved query performance due to columnar storage and predicate pushdown."

    {
      "operation": "Reading temperature data from 'BDA/input/temperature-readings.csv' using CSV format (line 74)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the stations data, temperature readings are loaded from a CSV file. Switching to Parquet or ORC will provide the same benefits as described above: faster reads, better compression, and improved query performance.",
