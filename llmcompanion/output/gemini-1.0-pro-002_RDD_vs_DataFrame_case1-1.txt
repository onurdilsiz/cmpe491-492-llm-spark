**Explanation:**

The provided code snippet does not use any RDDs. It exclusively utilizes DataFrames for data processing. Therefore, there are no RDD operations to analyze or replace with DataFrames for performance improvement.

**Benefits of Using DataFrames:**

While the provided code already leverages DataFrames, it's worth highlighting the advantages of using DataFrames over RDDs in general:

- **Structured Data Representation:** DataFrames provide a structured representation of data with columns and rows, making it easier to understand and manipulate.
- **Optimized Query Execution:** DataFrames leverage Spark's Catalyst Optimizer, which enables efficient query execution through query optimization techniques like predicate pushdown and column pruning.
- **Reduced Shuffling:** DataFrames minimize data shuffling by performing operations in-place whenever possible, leading to faster processing times.
- **Better Resource Utilization:** DataFrames efficiently utilize cluster resources by avoiding unnecessary data serialization and deserialization.
- **Rich API:** DataFrames offer a comprehensive API with various functions for data transformation, aggregation, and analysis, simplifying data manipulation tasks.

**Conclusion:**

The provided code effectively utilizes DataFrames for data processing, demonstrating an understanding of efficient data analysis techniques in Apache Spark.
