      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame to 1. However, since the subsequent operation is writing to a CSV file, which is a single-partition output format, the increased number of partitions is unnecessary. Using `coalesce()` instead would reduce the number of partitions to 1, minimizing data shuffling and improving resource utilization.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "df_5years.coalesce(1).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").mode(\"overwrite\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000-2005/repartition/1\")",
      "benefits": "Replacing `repartition()` with `coalesce()` in this case offers several benefits:\n\n* **Reduced shuffling:** By reducing the number of partitions to 1, we eliminate unnecessary data shuffling, which can significantly improve job performance.\n* **Improved resource utilization:** With fewer partitions, Spark can utilize resources more efficiently, leading to faster execution times.\n* **Faster runtime:** Overall, switching to `coalesce()` can result in a faster job runtime due to reduced shuffling and improved resource utilization."
