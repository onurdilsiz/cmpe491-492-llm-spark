            "improvementExplanation": "The code saves the `electronics_df` DataFrame to a CSV file. CSV is a text-based format, which is inefficient for large datasets.  It lacks built-in compression and doesn't support features like predicate pushdown, leading to slower read/write operations and increased storage costs. Switching to a columnar storage format like Parquet or ORC significantly improves performance by enabling efficient compression, predicate pushdown, and faster data access.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "electronics_df.write.format(\"parquet\").mode(\"overwrite\").save(\"path/to/electronics_sales_output.parquet\")",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet offers several benefits:\n- **Faster read/write operations:** Parquet's columnar storage allows reading only the necessary columns, significantly reducing I/O operations.\n- **Improved compression:** Parquet provides efficient compression, reducing storage space and improving read/write speeds.\n- **Predicate pushdown:** Parquet supports predicate pushdown, allowing Spark to filter data at the storage level, further improving query performance.\n- **Schema enforcement:** Parquet enforces schema, ensuring data integrity and consistency."
