      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition(100)` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame to 100. This is likely done to improve parallelism and potentially speed up subsequent operations. However, since the DataFrame is already partitioned by the `Origin` column, which likely has a large number of distinct values, increasing the number of partitions further may not be necessary. In this case, using `coalesce(100)` instead would achieve the same level of parallelism without incurring the overhead of a full shuffle.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "pred_row = pred_row.coalesce(100)",
      "benefits": "Replacing `repartition(100)` with `coalesce(100)` would avoid a full shuffle, which can significantly improve performance. This is because `coalesce()` only redistributes data within existing partitions, while `repartition()` requires a full shuffle to create new partitions. Additionally, using `coalesce()` can reduce resource usage by avoiding the need to create and manage additional partitions."
