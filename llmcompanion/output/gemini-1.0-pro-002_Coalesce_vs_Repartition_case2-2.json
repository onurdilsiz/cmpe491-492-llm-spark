            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the RDD. However, in this case, the `coalesce()` operation can be used instead to achieve the same result without shuffling the data. This is because the `coalesce()` operation simply merges existing partitions, while `repartition()` shuffles the data to create new partitions.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "coalesce(10000)",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` will reduce the amount of data shuffling, which can improve the performance of the job. Additionally, `coalesce()` can improve resource utilization by reducing the number of partitions that need to be processed."
