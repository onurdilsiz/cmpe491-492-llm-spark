            "improvementExplanation": "The code uses `repartition(10)` to increase the number of partitions to 10.  Since the initial DataFrame `df` likely has a small number of partitions (possibly 1, depending on the Spark configuration), a full shuffle is not necessary to reduce the number of partitions. `coalesce` can achieve the same outcome without a full shuffle if the target number of partitions is less than or equal to the current number of partitions. If the target number of partitions is greater than the current number, `coalesce` will still perform a shuffle, but it will be less expensive than `repartition` in most cases.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "repartitioned_df = df.coalesce(10)",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce(10)` avoids a full data shuffle if the initial number of partitions is greater than or equal to 10. This leads to reduced network traffic, lower resource consumption (CPU and memory), and faster job execution. If the initial number of partitions is less than 10, `coalesce` will perform a partial shuffle, which is still more efficient than the full shuffle performed by `repartition`."
