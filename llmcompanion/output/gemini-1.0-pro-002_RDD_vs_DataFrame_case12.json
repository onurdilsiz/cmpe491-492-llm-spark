            "improvementExplanation": "Repartitioning the DataFrame into a larger number of partitions can be inefficient and cause unnecessary shuffling when reducing partitions. In this case, the DataFrame is repartitioned to 10 partitions, which might not be necessary if the subsequent operations do not require that many partitions.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "Instead of using `repartition()`, consider using `coalesce()` to reduce the number of partitions if needed. `coalesce()` is more efficient than `repartition()` when reducing partitions.",
            "benefits": "Using `coalesce()` instead of `repartition()` can improve performance by reducing shuffling and resource usage."

            "rddOperation": "map()",
            "improvementExplanation": "Using `map()` on an RDD can be inefficient for element-wise operations. DataFrames offer optimized functions like `withColumn()` for such operations.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\ndiscounted_sales_df = sales_df.withColumn(\"discounted_amount\", sales_df[\"amount\"] * 0.9)\n```",
            "benefits": "Using `withColumn()` instead of `map()` can improve performance by leveraging Spark's optimized execution engine and reducing the need for data serialization and deserialization."
