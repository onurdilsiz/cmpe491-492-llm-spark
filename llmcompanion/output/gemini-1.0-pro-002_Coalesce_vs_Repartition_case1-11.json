            "operation": "df = df.repartition(1000)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame to 1000. However, since the DataFrame is already sorted by `time`, using `coalesce()` instead would achieve the same result without performing a full shuffle. This would reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred across the network, leading to improved resource usage and faster job runtime.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df = df.sort(asc('time')).coalesce(1000)",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` in this case would:\n- Reduce shuffling, as it only redistributes data without shuffling.\n- Improve resource usage, as it avoids unnecessary data transfers.\n- Potentially lead to faster job runtime, due to reduced shuffling and improved resource utilization."
