            "improvementExplanation": "The `state_convert` UDF can be replaced with Spark's built-in `map` function and a dictionary lookup. This avoids the overhead of creating and broadcasting a UDF, and allows Catalyst optimizations to be applied.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "```python\nresult = rdd.map(lambda x: (x[0], x[1], x[2], states[x[3]])).collect()\n```",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with a built-in function provides the following benefits:\n- Enables Catalyst optimizations for improved query performance.\n- Reduces serialization overhead by avoiding the need to broadcast the UDF.\n- Improves code readability and maintainability."
