```python
def improved_repartitioner(df, max_records_in_each_file, distribution_keys):
    dist_cols = [key.strip() for key in distribution_keys.split(",")]

    # Calculate the number of files per partition
    num_files_per_partition = F.ceil(F.col('records_count').cast('double') / F.lit(max_records_in_each_file))

    # Generate a salted key using a modulo operation
    salted_key = F.monotonically_increasing_id() % num_files_per_partition

    # Repartition the DataFrame based on the salted key
    return df.repartition(num_files_per_partition, salted_key)
```

This code snippet replaces the UDF with a series of built-in functions and operations:

- `F.ceil`: Calculates the ceiling of a value.
- `F.lit`: Creates a literal column.
- `F.monotonically_increasing_id`: Generates monotonically increasing 64-bit integers.
- `%`: Performs the modulo operation.
- `repartition`: Repartitions the DataFrame based on a specified column.

This approach avoids the overhead of defining and using a UDF, leading to improved performance and efficiency.

      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with built-in functions and native operations offers several benefits:\n\n- **Catalyst Optimizations:** Built-in functions and operations are optimized by Catalyst, Spark's query optimizer, leading to more efficient query execution plans.\n- **Performance Improvement:** Avoiding UDFs reduces serialization overhead and improves overall performance.\n- **Reduced Code Complexity:** Using built-in functions simplifies the code and makes it easier to maintain."
