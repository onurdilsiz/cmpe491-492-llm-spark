            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a CSV file using pandas.  CSV is a text-based format, leading to slower read times and larger file sizes compared to binary formats like Parquet or ORC.  Parquet and ORC offer better compression, columnar storage, and support for predicate pushdown, resulting in significantly faster query performance, especially for large datasets.  Switching to Parquet or ORC would eliminate the need for pandas and allow Spark to directly read and process the data.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName('airport').getOrCreate()\ndf = spark.read.parquet(\"airport-data.parquet\") # Or .orc(\"airport-data.orc\")",
            "benefits": "Faster read times, smaller file sizes due to compression, improved query performance through predicate pushdown and columnar storage.  Eliminates the need for pandas, improving integration with Spark."

            "operation": "Saving the model and indexer to disk using PipelineModel.load('airport-index/') and PipelineModel.load('airport-shiz/') on lines 36 and 37",
            "improvementExplanation": "While not explicitly shown as reading from a file, the loading of the model and indexer implies that they were previously saved to disk.  The default format for saving PipelineModels might not be optimized for storage or loading speed.  Saving these models in Parquet or ORC format would improve loading times and reduce storage space.",

            "benefits": "Faster model loading times, reduced storage space, improved overall application performance."
