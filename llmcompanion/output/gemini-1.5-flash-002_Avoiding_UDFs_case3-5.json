            "operation": "def haversine(lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2): ...",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `haversine` function calculates the great-circle distance between two points.  Spark doesn't have a built-in haversine function, but the calculation can be expressed using built-in trigonometric functions within a Spark SQL expression or a series of DataFrame operations. This avoids the overhead of a UDF.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "This requires a more complex expression within a Spark SQL query or a sequence of DataFrame transformations using `withColumn` and Spark's built-in trigonometric functions (sin, cos, asin, sqrt). A direct replacement isn't concise but is possible.",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF allows Spark's optimizer to incorporate the calculation into the query plan, potentially leading to better performance through parallel execution and optimized code generation. It also reduces the serialization overhead associated with UDFs."
        },
        {
            "operation": "def gaussian_kernel(x,h): ...",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `gaussian_kernel` function computes a Gaussian kernel. This can be directly replaced with Spark's built-in `exp` function within a Spark SQL expression or a DataFrame transformation.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import exp\n... \ndataframe = dataframe.withColumn('gaussian_kernel', exp(-(col('x') / col('h'))**2))\n```",
            "benefits": "Eliminating the UDF allows Spark's Catalyst optimizer to push down the computation, improving performance and reducing the overhead of data serialization and deserialization."
        },
        {
            "operation": "def get_k_dist(long1, lat1, long2, lat2,h): ...",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `get_k_dist` function combines the `haversine` and `gaussian_kernel` functions. As mentioned above, `haversine` needs a more complex replacement, but `gaussian_kernel` can be replaced as shown previously. The entire function can be replaced by combining the equivalent expressions for `haversine` and `gaussian_kernel` within a Spark SQL expression or DataFrame transformation.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "Similar to `haversine`, this requires a complex expression combining Spark's built-in trigonometric and exponential functions within a Spark SQL query or a series of DataFrame operations using `withColumn`.",
            "benefits": "The benefits are the same as for `haversine` and `gaussian_kernel`: improved performance due to Catalyst optimization and reduced serialization overhead."

        {
            "operation": "def get_k_days(day, pred_day,h): ...",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `get_k_days` function calculates the difference in days and applies the Gaussian kernel. The date difference can be computed using Spark's built-in date functions, and the Gaussian kernel can be replaced as before.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import datediff, exp\n... \ndataframe = dataframe.withColumn('k_days', exp(-(datediff(col('pred_day'), col('day')) / col('h'))**2))\n```",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF enables Catalyst optimizations, leading to improved performance and reduced serialization overhead."
