            "improvementExplanation": "The current `map` operation applies the `state_convert` function to each element of the RDD. Since `state_convert` uses a broadcast variable, it's more efficient to perform this lookup once per partition rather than once per record. `mapPartitions` allows us to process each partition as a whole, reducing the overhead of calling `state_convert` repeatedly. We can retrieve the broadcast variable once per partition and then apply the transformation to each record within that partition.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "result = rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: [(x[0], x[1], x[2], broadcastStates.value[x[3]]) for x in partition]).collect()",
            "benefits": "Switching to `mapPartitions` reduces the overhead of accessing the broadcast variable `broadcastStates.value`. Instead of accessing it for every record, it's accessed once per partition. This reduces function call overhead and can lead to performance improvements, especially when the broadcast variable is large or the transformation is computationally expensive. It also optimizes resource utilization by reducing the number of times the broadcast variable is accessed."
