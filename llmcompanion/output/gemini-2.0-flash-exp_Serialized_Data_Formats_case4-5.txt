      "operation": "pandas.DataFrame.to_parquet in `write_to_parquet` function",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code currently uses pandas to write data to parquet files. While parquet is a good choice, using Spark's native parquet writer would be more efficient as it avoids the overhead of converting to pandas DataFrame and then writing to parquet. Spark's writer is also optimized for distributed processing.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n    def write_to_parquet(data, dir_path, chunk, spark):\n        \"\"\" write data chunks to parquet \"\"\"\n        parquet_path = dir_path + 'page_data_chunk_' + str(chunk) + '.parquet'\n        columns = ['idx', 'chunk', 'page_id', 'page_name', 'page_bytearray']\n        df = spark.createDataFrame(data, columns=columns)\n        df.write.parquet(parquet_path)\n\n    # Inside write_pages_data_to_dir function\n    spark = SparkSession.builder.appName('trec_car_spark').getOrCreate()\n    if ((i+1) % chunks == 0) and (i != 0 or num_pages == 1):\n        if write_output:\n            print('WRITING TO FILE: {}'.format(i))\n            write_to_parquet(data=pages_data, dir_path=dir_path, chunk=chunk, spark=spark)\n\n            # begin new list\n            pages_data = []\n            chunk += 1\n\n    if write_output and (len(pages_data) > 0):\n        print('WRITING FINAL FILE: {}'.format(i))\n        write_to_parquet(data=pages_data, dir_path=dir_path, chunk=chunk, spark=spark)\n```",
      "benefits": "Using Spark's native parquet writer will improve performance by leveraging Spark's distributed processing capabilities and avoiding unnecessary data conversions. It also allows for better integration with the rest of the Spark pipeline."

      "operation": "spark.read.parquet in `pyspark_processing` function",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads parquet files using Spark's native reader. This is already an optimized approach for reading data in a distributed manner. No change is needed here.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "No change needed.",
      "benefits": "Parquet is a columnar storage format that allows for efficient reading of specific columns, predicate pushdown, and compression, leading to faster query execution."

    {
      "operation": "pickle.dumps in `write_pages_data_to_dir` function",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code uses pickle to serialize the `page` object into a byte array before writing it to parquet. While pickle is flexible, it's not ideal for long-term storage or interoperability. It's better to serialize the relevant fields of the `page` object into a structured format like Parquet or ORC directly, avoiding the double serialization (pickle then parquet). However, this would require significant changes to the data model and is not a simple replacement.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n    # Inside write_pages_data_to_dir function\n    # Instead of pickling the entire page object, extract relevant fields\n    pages_data.append([i, chunk, page.page_id, page.page_name, page.skeleton, page.metadata])\n\n    # Inside write_to_parquet function\n    columns = ['idx', 'chunk', 'page_id', 'page_name', 'page_skeleton', 'page_metadata']\n    df = spark.createDataFrame(data, columns=columns)\n    df.write.parquet(parquet_path)\n\n    # Inside pyspark_processing function\n    df = df.withColumn(\"synthetic_entity_linking\", synthetic_page_skeleton_and_paragraphs_udf(\"page_skeleton\", \"page_metadata\"))\n\n    @udf(returnType=BinaryType())\n    def synthetic_page_skeleton_and_paragraphs_udf(skeleton, metadata):\n        # Instead of loading from bytearray, use the skeleton and metadata directly\n        # ... rest of the function\n```",
      "benefits": "Directly storing the relevant fields in Parquet will avoid the overhead of pickling and unpickling, leading to faster reads and writes. It also makes the data more accessible and interoperable."
    },
    {
      "operation": "pickle.loads in `synthetic_page_skeleton_and_paragraphs_udf` function",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code uses pickle to deserialize the byte array back into a `page` object. This is inefficient and can be avoided by directly working with the structured data. As mentioned above, it's better to store the relevant fields of the `page` object directly in Parquet and access them directly in the UDF.",

It's better to write to a distributed file system using Spark's native writer, which can handle large datasets more efficiently. Also, the double pickle punchy should be removed.",
