            "operation": "map() operation on json_rdd in line 34",
            "improvementExplanation": "The map() operation in line 34 processes each element of the json_rdd individually. This can lead to inefficient I/O and function call overhead, especially when dealing with large datasets. By replacing map() with mapPartitions(), we can process data in batches, reducing the number of function calls and improving I/O efficiency.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\njson_rdd = uri_rdd.mapPartitions(process_partition)\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() offers several benefits:\n\n* **Reduced function call overhead:** By processing data in batches, we reduce the number of function calls, leading to improved performance.\n* **Optimized I/O:** Batching data allows for more efficient I/O operations, as data can be read and processed in larger chunks.\n* **Improved resource utilization:** By reducing function call overhead and optimizing I/O, mapPartitions() can lead to better resource utilization."
