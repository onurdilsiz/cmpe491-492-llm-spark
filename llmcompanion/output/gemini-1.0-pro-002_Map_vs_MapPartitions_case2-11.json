            "improvementExplanation": "The map() operation on json_rdd in line 44 processes each element individually, which can lead to increased function call overhead and suboptimal I/O performance. By replacing it with mapPartitions(), we can process elements in batches, reducing function call overhead and improving I/O efficiency.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\njson_rdd = uri_rdd.mapPartitions(process_partition)\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() in this case can provide the following benefits:\n\n* **Reduced function call overhead:** By processing elements in batches, we can reduce the number of function calls required, leading to improved performance.\n* **Optimized I/O:** mapPartitions() allows for more efficient I/O operations, as data can be read and processed in larger chunks.\n* **Improved resource utilization:** By reducing function call overhead and optimizing I/O, mapPartitions() can lead to better resource utilization."
