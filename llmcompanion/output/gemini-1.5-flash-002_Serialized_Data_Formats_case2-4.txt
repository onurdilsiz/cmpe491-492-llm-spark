    {
      "operation": "Input operation: Reading data from CSV file at line 12: `lines = sc.textFile(sys.argv[1], 1)`",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a CSV file using `sc.textFile`. CSV is a text-based format, leading to slower processing and higher storage costs compared to binary formats like Parquet or ORC.  Parquet and ORC offer better compression, schema enforcement, and support for predicate pushdown, resulting in faster query execution and reduced storage.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "Assuming the input CSV has a header row and the relevant column is at index 16:\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"CSVToParquet\").getOrCreate()\ndf = spark.read.csv(sys.argv[1], header=True, inferSchema=True)\ndf = df.withColumn('new_column', when(length(col('column_at_index_16')) == 0, lit('NULL\\tNULL\\tNULL')).otherwise(lit('TEXT\\tPREMISES\\tVALID')))\ndf.write.parquet('check_prem_typ_desc.parquet')\nspark.stop()\n```\nNote: Replace `'column_at_index_16'` with the actual column name from your CSV header.  This requires installing `pyspark` and potentially other dependencies.",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet offers significant performance improvements due to its columnar storage, efficient compression, and support for predicate pushdown. This leads to faster reads, writes, and query execution, especially for large datasets.  It also reduces storage costs due to compression."

    {
      "operation": "Output operation: Writing data to text file at line 16: `results.saveAsTextFile('check_prem_typ_desc.out')`",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code writes the results to a text file using `saveAsTextFile`.  Similar to the input, this is inefficient for large datasets. Parquet or ORC provide better compression and faster write speeds.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "Continuing from the optimized input example:\n```python\n# ... (previous code) ...\ndf.write.parquet('check_prem_typ_desc.parquet')\n```",
      "benefits": "Writing to Parquet results in smaller file sizes due to compression and faster write operations.  This is particularly beneficial for large datasets where writing to text files can be extremely slow."
