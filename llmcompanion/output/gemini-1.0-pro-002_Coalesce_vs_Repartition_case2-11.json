            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to create a new RDD with the specified number of partitions. However, in this case, the `parallelize()` method is already creating an RDD with the desired number of partitions (equal to the length of the `distinct_buckets` list). Therefore, using `repartition()` is redundant and can be replaced with `coalesce()` to avoid unnecessary shuffling.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "uri_rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(distinct_buckets)",
            "benefits": "Replacing `repartition()` with `coalesce()` in this case will eliminate unnecessary shuffling, reduce resource usage, and potentially improve the job runtime."
