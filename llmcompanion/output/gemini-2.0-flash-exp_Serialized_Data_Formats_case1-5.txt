      "operation": "Reading text file from HDFS: `df1 = spark.read.text(\"hdfs://namenode/user/controller/ncdc-orig/2000-2018.txt\")`",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current code reads a text file. Text files are not optimized for analytical workloads. They lack schema information, require parsing, and are not compressed efficiently. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance, especially if only a subset of columns is needed. Parquet is generally preferred for its better compression and wider support.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\ndf1 = spark.read.parquet(\"hdfs://namenode/user/controller/ncdc-orig/2000-2018.parquet\")\n```\nNote: This assumes the data is already converted to Parquet format. If not, you would need to convert the text file to Parquet once and then use the Parquet file for subsequent reads. The conversion can be done using a similar write operation as shown in the next entry.",
      "benefits": "Faster reads due to columnar storage, schema awareness, and efficient compression. Predicate pushdown can also be used to filter data at the storage layer, reducing the amount of data read."

      "improvementExplanation": "The current code writes data in CSV format. While CSV is human-readable, it is not efficient for storage and retrieval in analytical workloads. It lacks schema information, requires parsing, and is not compressed as effectively as columnar formats. Switching to Parquet or ORC would improve write performance, reduce storage space, and enable faster reads in subsequent operations.",
