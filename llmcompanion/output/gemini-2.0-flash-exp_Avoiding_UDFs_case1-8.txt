    {
      "operation": "pred_df = pred_df.withColumn(\"difference\", hi)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code calculates the squared difference between 'price' and 'prediction' columns using a manual calculation. This can be replaced with Spark's built-in `pow` function and column arithmetic, which are optimized by Catalyst and avoid the overhead of creating an intermediate variable `hi`.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "pred_df = pred_df.withColumn(\"difference\", pow(pred_df[\"price\"] - pred_df[\"prediction\"], 2))",
      "benefits": "Replacing the manual calculation with Spark's built-in `pow` function and column arithmetic enables Catalyst optimizations, improves performance by avoiding unnecessary intermediate variable creation, and reduces serialization overhead."
