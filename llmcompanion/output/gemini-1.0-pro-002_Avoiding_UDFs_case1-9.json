            "improvementExplanation": "The UDF `splitPaths` can be replaced with the built-in function `split` from the `pyspark.sql.functions` module. This function splits a string into an array of substrings based on a delimiter. In this case, the delimiter is the forward slash (`/`).",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "```python\nsplitPathsUDF = udf(lambda str: str.split('/'), ArrayType(StringType(),False))\nexplodedPaths = csvDF.withColumn(\"Path\", explode(splitPathsUDF(csvDF[\"Path\"])))\n```",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with a built-in function offers several benefits:\n- **Catalyst Optimizations:** Built-in functions are optimized by Catalyst, Spark's query optimizer, leading to improved query performance.\n- **Performance Improvement:** Built-in functions are generally more efficient than UDFs, as they are written in Scala and compiled to native code.\n- **Reduced Serialization Overhead:** UDFs require serialization and deserialization, which can add overhead to data processing. Built-in functions avoid this overhead."
