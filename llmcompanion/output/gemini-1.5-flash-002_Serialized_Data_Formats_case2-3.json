            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads a text file using sc.textFile.  Switching to Parquet or ORC would significantly improve performance, especially for large datasets, due to their columnar storage and efficient compression.  Text files are row-oriented and lack built-in compression, leading to slower reads and increased storage costs.",

            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads a JSON file line by line using sc.textFile and then parses each line individually with json.loads. This is inefficient.  Storing the data in Parquet or ORC format would allow Spark to read and process the data directly in a more optimized manner.",

            "improvementExplanation": "Reading JSON files directly into a DataFrame is convenient, but Parquet or ORC offer better performance for large datasets due to their optimized storage and processing capabilities.  JSON is not a columnar format and lacks efficient compression.",
