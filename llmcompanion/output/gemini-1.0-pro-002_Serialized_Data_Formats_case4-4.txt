**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any input/output operations. It focuses on creating and manipulating DataFrames using user-defined functions (UDFs). While UDFs can interact with external data sources, the code snippet provided does not demonstrate any such interaction. Therefore, there are no opportunities to optimize input/output operations by switching to serialized data formats like Parquet or ORC.
