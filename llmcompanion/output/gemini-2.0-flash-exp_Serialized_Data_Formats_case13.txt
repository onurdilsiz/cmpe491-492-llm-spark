      "improvementExplanation": "The current code saves the filtered data in CSV format, which is a text-based format. CSV files are not optimized for analytical workloads because they lack schema information, require parsing, and are not compressed. Switching to a columnar, binary format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve performance. Parquet, in particular, is well-suited for Spark due to its columnar storage, which allows for efficient predicate pushdown and data skipping, leading to faster reads and reduced I/O. It also supports compression, reducing storage space and I/O overhead.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nelectronics_df.write.format(\"parquet\").save(\"path/to/electronics_sales_output.parquet\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet offers several benefits:\n- **Faster Reads:** Columnar storage allows Spark to read only the necessary columns, reducing I/O.\n- **Compression:** Parquet files are typically compressed, reducing storage space and I/O.\n- **Predicate Pushdown:** Spark can push down filters to the data source, reading only the relevant data.\n- **Schema Evolution:** Parquet supports schema evolution, making it easier to handle changes in data structure.\n- **Type Safety:** Parquet stores schema information, enabling type safety and avoiding parsing overhead."
