```json
{
  "detected": false,
  "occurrences": 0,
  "response": []
}
```

**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of User-Defined Functions (UDFs). Therefore, the "detected" field is set to "false," and the "occurrences" field is set to 0. Consequently, the "response" array is empty.

**Benefits of Avoiding UDFs:**

While UDFs can be useful for extending Spark's functionality, they can also introduce performance overhead and limit optimization opportunities. Replacing UDFs with built-in functions or native DataFrame/Dataset operations can provide several benefits:

- **Catalyst Optimizations:** Spark's Catalyst optimizer can effectively optimize built-in functions and native operations, resulting in improved query performance.
- **Performance Improvement:** Built-in functions and native operations are often implemented in a more efficient manner than UDFs, leading to faster execution times.
- **Reduced Serialization Overhead:** UDFs require serialization and deserialization, which can add overhead to data processing. Using built-in functions or native operations can reduce this overhead.

**Conclusion:**

The provided Spark code does not utilize UDFs, so there are no opportunities for replacement with built-in functions or native operations. However, it is generally recommended to prioritize built-in functions and native operations over UDFs whenever possible to optimize performance and leverage Catalyst optimizations.
