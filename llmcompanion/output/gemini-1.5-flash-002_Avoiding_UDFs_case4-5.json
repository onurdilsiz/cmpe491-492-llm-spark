            "improvementExplanation": "The `synthetic_page_skeleton_and_paragraphs_udf` UDF performs complex processing involving nested structures and custom data types.  This makes it difficult for Spark's optimizer to reason about and potentially prevents optimizations.  It's better to break down the UDF's logic into smaller, more manageable functions that can leverage Spark's built-in functions and data structures.  The core logic of processing the nested `skeleton` structure can be implemented using Spark's higher-order functions like `transform` and `explode` along with struct manipulation. The `get_bodies_from_text` function, which uses spaCy, is inherently sequential and cannot be parallelized within Spark.  It should be executed outside of Spark, potentially using a separate process or library designed for distributed text processing.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import expr, from_json, to_json, col\n\n# ... (other code) ...\n\ndef process_page(page_bytes):\n    # ... (load page using pickle.loads(page_bytes)) ...\n    # ... (process skeleton using higher-order functions and struct manipulation) ...\n    # ... (use get_bodies_from_text outside of Spark) ...\n    return pickle.dumps([synthetic_skeleton, synthetic_paragraphs])\n\n# ... (other code) ...\ndf = df.withColumn(\"synthetic_entity_linking\", expr(\"process_page(page_bytearray)\"))\n```",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with a combination of built-in functions and optimized data structures enables Catalyst optimizations, leading to improved performance and reduced serialization overhead.  Breaking down the complex logic into smaller, more manageable functions improves code readability and maintainability.  Offloading the spaCy processing to a separate process avoids the overhead of serializing and deserializing the spaCy model across the Spark cluster."
