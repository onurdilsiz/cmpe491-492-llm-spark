            "operation": "Reading data from a text file using `spark.sparkContext.textFile()` (line 6)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a text file, which is an inefficient format for Spark processing. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve performance due to faster reads, compression, and query optimization through predicate pushdown.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read data from a Parquet file\nparquet_df = spark.read.parquet(\"/path/to/data.parquet\")\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC would provide the following benefits:\n* **Faster reads/writes:** Serialized formats like Parquet and ORC are optimized for Spark processing, resulting in significantly faster read and write operations.\n* **Compression:** These formats compress data efficiently, reducing storage requirements and network transfer times.\n* **Query optimization:** Parquet and ORC support predicate pushdown, which allows Spark to filter data at the file level before reading it, further improving query performance."
