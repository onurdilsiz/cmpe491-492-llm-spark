      "improvementExplanation": "The code uses `repartition(1)` before writing the data to a CSV file.  Since the goal is to reduce the number of output files to 1, and the number of partitions is already likely less than 1, a full shuffle is unnecessary. `coalesce(1)` can achieve the same result without the overhead of a full shuffle.  `coalesce` will only perform a partial shuffle if the number of partitions is greater than 1; otherwise, it will simply adjust the partition boundaries without shuffling.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "df_5years.coalesce(1).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").mode(\"overwrite\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000-2005/coalesce/1\")",
      "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce(1)` avoids unnecessary shuffling, leading to reduced execution time, lower resource consumption (CPU, memory, and network bandwidth), and improved overall job performance. The improvement will be particularly noticeable for large datasets."
