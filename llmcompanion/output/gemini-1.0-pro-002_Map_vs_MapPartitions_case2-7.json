            "operation": "Multiply A.T * A (line 24)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The operation involves multiplying each row of A with its transpose and accumulating the results in a matrix. This can be efficiently performed at the partition level using `mapPartitions()` to avoid unnecessary data shuffling and function call overhead.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\nAT_A = np.zeros((1000,1000)) # Initialize AT_A. This will hold the result of A.T * A\nstart = time.time()\n# Explanation of the following for loop in the report\nfor i,partition in enumerate( A.mapPartitions(lambda part: [np.outer(row,row) for row in part]).toLocalIterator() ):\n    print(f\"\\nPartition no. {i+1}/40000\")\n    for row in partition:\n        AT_A += row\nstep1 = time.time()\nprint(f\"\\n Time for A^T* * A = {step1-start:.4f}\")\n```",
            "benefits": "Replacing `map()` with `mapPartitions()` in this case offers several benefits:\n\n* **Reduced function call overhead:** By performing the outer product calculation within each partition, we avoid the overhead of calling the `np.outer()` function for each individual row.\n* **Optimized I/O:** Data is processed within each partition, minimizing data shuffling between partitions and improving I/O efficiency.\n* **Improved resource utilization:** By processing data in larger batches, we can potentially utilize resources more efficiently, leading to faster execution times."
