**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any explicit input/output operations. While the code does manipulate data using RDDs and DataFrames, these operations do not involve reading data from external sources or writing data to external files. Therefore, there are no opportunities to optimize data formats for improved performance.

**Additional Notes:**

* The code snippet provided demonstrates various RDD transformations and actions, including `flatMap`, `map`, `reduceByKey`, `filter`, and `sortByKey`. These operations are performed in-memory and do not involve external data sources.
* The DataFrame creation and manipulation using `toDF`, `select`, and `show` methods also do not involve reading or writing data to external files.
* While the code does not explicitly perform input/output operations, it is important to consider data format optimization when working with external data sources in Spark applications. Using serialized formats like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve performance for read and write operations.
