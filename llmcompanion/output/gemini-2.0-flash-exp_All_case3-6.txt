      "optimizedEquivalent": "customerDF = spark.read.parquet(\"retailstore.parquet\") # Assuming you have converted the CSV to Parquet\n# Or\ncustomerDF = spark.read.format(\"parquet\").load(\"retailstore.parquet\")\n# Or\n# customerDF.write.parquet(\"retailstore.parquet\") # To write the dataframe to parquet format",
      "benefits": "Using Parquet, ORC, or Avro provides faster read/write speeds, schema evolution, compression, and predicate pushdown, which significantly improves query performance and reduces storage costs."
