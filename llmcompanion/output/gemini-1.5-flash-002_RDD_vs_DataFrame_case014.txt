    {
      "rddOperation": "transactions_rdd.map(lambda line: line.split(\",\"))  # Inefficient RDD processing\n\nelectronics_transactions_rdd = parsed_transactions_rdd.filter(lambda txn: txn[3] == \"Electronics\")  # Filtering for \"Electronics\"",
      "improvementExplanation": "Using RDDs for data transformations is less efficient than using DataFrames. DataFrames provide optimized execution plans and leverage Spark's Catalyst optimizer, resulting in faster processing and better resource utilization.  RDD operations lack the optimization capabilities of DataFrames.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "from pyspark.sql.functions import col\n\ntransactions_df = spark.read.csv(\"path/to/transactions.txt\", header=False, inferSchema=True)\nelectronics_transactions_df = transactions_df.filter(col(\"_c3\") == \"Electronics\")",
      "benefits": "DataFrames offer significant performance improvements over RDDs due to Catalyst optimization, reduced data serialization/deserialization, and efficient execution plans.  This leads to faster processing times, reduced resource consumption (CPU, memory, network), and improved scalability for larger datasets."

    {
      "rddOperation": "print(\"Number of partitions after repartition:\", repartitioned_df.rdd.getNumPartitions())",
      "improvementExplanation": "Accessing the RDD from a DataFrame is generally unnecessary and can hinder performance.  Directly working with the DataFrame API is more efficient.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "print(\"Number of partitions after repartition:\", repartitioned_df.rdd.getNumPartitions())  #This line remains the same as it's already using the DataFrame's rdd attribute to get the number of partitions.  However, it's best to avoid such access if possible.",
      "benefits": "Avoiding unnecessary access to the underlying RDD improves performance by preventing extra overhead associated with RDD operations.  It keeps the processing within the optimized DataFrame execution engine."
