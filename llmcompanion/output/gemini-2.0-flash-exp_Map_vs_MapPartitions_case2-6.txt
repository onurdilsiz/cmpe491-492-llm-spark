      "operation": "hbase_rdd = hbase_rdd.map(lambda x: x[1]).map(lambda x: x.split(\"\\n\"))",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code uses two consecutive `map` operations on the `hbase_rdd`. The first `map` extracts the value from the key-value pair, and the second `map` splits the string by newlines. These operations can be combined into a single `mapPartitions` operation to reduce function call overhead. Instead of applying the lambda function to each element individually, `mapPartitions` applies it to each partition, allowing for batch processing and potentially more efficient execution.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "hbase_rdd = hbase_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: (x[1].split(\"\\n\") for x in partition))",
      "benefits": "By using `mapPartitions`, we reduce the overhead of calling the lambda function for each element. The function is applied once per partition, which can lead to significant performance improvements, especially when dealing with large datasets. This also allows for potential optimizations within the partition processing."

      "operation": "result = data_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda iter: predict(iter))",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `predict` function is already being called within a `mapPartitions` transformation. This is the correct approach for this operation, as it involves loading a model and performing inference, which is best done at the partition level to avoid reloading the model for each record. No change is needed here.",
