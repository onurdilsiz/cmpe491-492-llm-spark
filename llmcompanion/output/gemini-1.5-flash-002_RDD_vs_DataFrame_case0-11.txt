**Note:**  The provided solution assumes that the `ratings.csv` file does not have a header row. If it does, you'll need to adjust the DataFrame creation code accordingly (using `header=True`).  Also, the solution uses `pyspark.sql.functions` as `F` for brevity.  Remember to `import pyspark.sql.functions as F` at the beginning of your script.  The `join` operation between `movie_rating_counts` and `movie_average_ratings` requires a more detailed equivalent in the DataFrame approach, involving joins based on the common `movie_id` column.  The exact implementation of the join would depend on the specific schema and data types.  Finally, the `sortBy` operation in the RDD code and its DataFrame equivalent need adjustments to handle the nested structure of the data.  The provided DataFrame solutions offer a more efficient and readable approach compared to the original RDD-based code.
