      "improvementExplanation": "The `filter` operation on the `csvDF` RDD can be replaced with a DataFrame filter, which is optimized for data processing and can potentially improve performance.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\ncsvDF = csvDF.select(\"Path\", \"BlocksCount\", \"FileSize\").filter(\"BlocksCount != 0\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Using a DataFrame filter instead of an RDD filter can lead to better query optimization, reduced shuffling of data, and more efficient resource utilization."

      "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\ncsvDF = csvDF.withColumn(\"Path\", split(csvDF[\"Path\"], \"/\"))\n```",
      "benefits": "Using a DataFrame transformation instead of an RDD map can improve performance by leveraging Spark's optimized execution engine and reducing the need for data serialization and deserialization."
