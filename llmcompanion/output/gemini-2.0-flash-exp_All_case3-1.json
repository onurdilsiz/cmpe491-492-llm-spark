CSV files are text-based, lack schema information, and are not easily splittable. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet, ORC, or Avro can significantly improve read performance, reduce storage space, and enable predicate pushdown.",

            "benefits": "Using Parquet (or ORC/Avro) provides faster reads due to columnar storage, compression, schema enforcement, and predicate pushdown, which can significantly reduce I/O and improve query performance."

            "improvementExplanation": "The code uses custom functions `get_static`, `remove_rare_categories`, and `generate_rolling_aggregate`. While these functions might be necessary for specific logic, it's crucial to evaluate if they can be replaced with Spark SQL functions or native DataFrame/Dataset operations. UDFs can hinder Catalyst optimizations and introduce serialization overhead. For example, `generate_rolling_aggregate` can be implemented using window functions.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "For `generate_rolling_aggregate`, the equivalent can be achieved using window functions. For example, for `source_ip_count_last_min`:\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.window import Window\nwindow_spec = Window.partitionBy(\"source_ip\").orderBy(\"dt\").rangeBetween(-60, 0)\ndf = df.withColumn(\"source_ip_count_last_min\", F.count(\"source_ip\").over(window_spec))\n```\nSimilar logic can be applied to other aggregations. `get_static` and `remove_rare_categories` can also be implemented using Spark SQL functions like `groupBy`, `agg`, `filter`, and `count`.",
            "benefits": "Replacing UDFs with Spark SQL functions or native DataFrame/Dataset operations enables Catalyst optimizations, improves performance by avoiding serialization overhead, and makes the code more maintainable and easier to understand."
