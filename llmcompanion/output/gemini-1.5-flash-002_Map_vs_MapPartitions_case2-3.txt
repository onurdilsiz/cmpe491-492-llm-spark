    {
      "operation": "Line 48: `result = sc.textFile(json_file).map(json.loads)`",
      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation applies `json.loads` to each line individually.  Since `json.loads` is an I/O-bound operation, processing multiple lines within a partition using mapPartitions would reduce the overhead of repeatedly calling the function and potentially improve I/O efficiency by batching the JSON parsing.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "result = sc.textFile(json_file).mapPartitions(lambda iterator: map(json.loads, iterator))",
      "benefits": "Reduced function call overhead, improved I/O efficiency through batch processing."

      "operation": "Line 66: `df = sc.textFile(txt_file).map(lambda line: line.split(','))`",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `line.split(',')` operation is relatively inexpensive, but processing multiple lines within a partition could still offer minor performance gains by reducing the overhead of repeatedly calling the lambda function.  The benefit might be more pronounced with more complex string processing.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "df = sc.textFile(txt_file).mapPartitions(lambda iterator: map(lambda line: line.split(','), iterator))",
      "benefits": "Slightly reduced function call overhead, potential for minor performance improvement."
