      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation iterates over each element in the RDD to calculate the distance, days, and hour kernels. These calculations involve accessing external data sources (stations dictionary) and performing mathematical operations. By using mapPartitions, we can process these calculations in batches, reducing the number of function calls and improving I/O efficiency.",
