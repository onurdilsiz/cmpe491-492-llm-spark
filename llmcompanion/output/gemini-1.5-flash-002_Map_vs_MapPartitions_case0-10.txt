      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation adds a '1' to each element.  This is a lightweight operation that doesn't benefit significantly from mapPartitions. The overhead of managing iterators might outweigh the gains.  While technically possible, the performance improvement would likely be negligible or even negative.",

      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation swaps the elements of each tuple.  This is a lightweight operation; however, if the RDD is very large, using mapPartitions could reduce the function call overhead.  The key sorting operation (sortByKey) is already optimized in Spark, so the performance improvement might be marginal.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "rdd5 = rdd4.mapPartitions(lambda x: map(lambda y: (y[1], y[0]), x)).sortByKey()",
      "benefits": "Potential for reduced function call overhead, leading to slightly improved performance, especially for very large RDDs.  The improvement might be marginal due to the efficiency of Spark's sortByKey operation."
