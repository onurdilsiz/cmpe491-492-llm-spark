    {
      "operation": "filtered_df.repartition(10)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame to 10. However, since we are only writing the DataFrame to a file, we don't need to shuffle the data across multiple partitions. Instead, we can use `coalesce()` to reduce the number of partitions to 1, which will improve efficiency by reducing the amount of data that needs to be written to disk.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "filtered_df.coalesce(1)",
      "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` will reduce the amount of data that needs to be shuffled and written to disk, resulting in a faster job runtime and improved resource usage."
