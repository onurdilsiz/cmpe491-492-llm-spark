            "operation": "The UDF `is_number` is used on line 24 to determine if a string is a valid number.",
            "improvementExplanation": "The UDF `is_number` can be replaced with Spark's built-in function `col('column_name').cast('int')` to check if a string can be cast to an integer. This avoids the overhead of defining and registering a UDF, and allows Catalyst optimizations to be applied.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "```python\n# Import the required function\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col\n\n# Apply the transformation using the built-in function\nflat_q3 = flat_q3.filter(col('value').cast('int').isNotNull())\n```",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with a built-in function provides the following benefits:\n* **Enables Catalyst optimizations:** Catalyst can optimize the execution plan for built-in functions, leading to improved performance.\n* **Improves performance:** Built-in functions are generally more efficient than UDFs, as they are implemented in Scala and compiled to native code.\n* **Reduces serialization overhead:** UDFs need to be serialized and sent to executors, which can add overhead. Built-in functions are already available on executors, eliminating this overhead."
