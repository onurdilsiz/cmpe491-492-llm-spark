      "operation": "Reading text data from HDFS in CSV format (line 10):\n`df1 = spark.read.text(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/csv-file\")`",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a CSV file stored in HDFS using the `spark.read.text` method.  This method treats the data as plain text, requiring significant parsing to extract structured information.  Switching to Parquet or ORC would eliminate this parsing overhead. Parquet and ORC are columnar storage formats that store data in a more efficient way for analytical processing. They also support compression and schema enforcement, leading to faster read times and reduced storage space.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "Assuming the CSV file has a header row and the data is consistently formatted, we can directly read it as a Parquet file if it's already converted. If not, we first need to convert the CSV to Parquet:\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import * \n#Infer schema from the first few lines of the CSV file\ndf1 = spark.read.csv(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/csv-file\", header=True, inferSchema=True)\ndf1.write.parquet(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/parquet-file\")\n#Then read the parquet file\ndf1 = spark.read.parquet(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/parquet-file\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Faster read speeds due to columnar storage and efficient data encoding. Reduced storage space due to compression. Improved query performance due to predicate pushdown and schema enforcement."

      "operation": "Writing data to HDFS in CSV format (lines 38-41):\n`df2.repartition(50).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/repartition/50\")`",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code writes the processed DataFrame to HDFS as a CSV file with LZ4 compression. While LZ4 provides some compression, Parquet or ORC offer significantly better compression ratios and faster write speeds, especially for large datasets.  Parquet and ORC's columnar storage also allows for writing only the necessary columns, further improving efficiency.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\ndf2.repartition(50).write.parquet(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/repartition/50\", mode=\"overwrite\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Faster write speeds due to optimized encoding and columnar storage.  Higher compression ratios resulting in smaller file sizes and reduced storage costs. Improved query performance when reading the data back into Spark."
