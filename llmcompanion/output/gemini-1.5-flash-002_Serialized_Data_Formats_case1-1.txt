      "operation": "Reading text data from HDFS in CSV format (line 10):\n`df1 = spark.read.text(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/csv-file\")`",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a CSV file stored in HDFS using the `spark.read.text` method.  This method treats the data as plain text, requiring significant parsing to extract structured information.  Switching to Parquet or ORC would eliminate this parsing overhead.  Parquet and ORC are columnar storage formats that store data in a more efficient way for analytical queries, enabling faster reads and better compression.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "Assuming the CSV file has a header row and the first row contains column names, we can directly read it as a Parquet file if it's converted beforehand. If not, a schema needs to be defined.  Example (assuming Parquet conversion is done):\n```python\ndf1 = spark.read.parquet(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/parquet-file\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Faster read speeds, improved compression, and reduced memory usage due to columnar storage and efficient encoding.  Predicate pushdown will also be enabled for faster query execution."

      "improvementExplanation": "The code writes data to HDFS in CSV format with LZ4 compression. While LZ4 provides some compression, Parquet and ORC offer significantly better compression ratios and faster write speeds, especially for large datasets.  They also support efficient encoding of various data types.",

      "benefits": "Faster write speeds, significantly better compression leading to reduced storage costs, and improved query performance when reading the data back into Spark."
