      "operation": "Reading text data from HDFS in CSV format (line 10):\n`df1 = spark.read.text(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/csv-file\")`",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a CSV file stored in HDFS.  CSV is a human-readable format, but it's inefficient for Spark due to its lack of schema information and compression.  Switching to Parquet or ORC provides schema enforcement, columnar storage, and compression, leading to significantly faster read and write operations and reduced storage costs.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "Assuming the CSV file has a header, and the first row contains column names:\n```python\ndf1 = spark.read.csv(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/csv-file\", header=True, inferSchema=True)\n```\nIf no header is present, you'll need to specify the schema manually:\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, StringType, IntegerType, FloatType\nschema = StructType([\n    StructField(\"Weather_Station\", StringType(), True),\n    StructField(\"WBAN\", StringType(), True),\n    # ... add other fields with appropriate types ...\n])\ndf1 = spark.read.csv(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/csv-file\", schema=schema)\n```\nThen, you can convert to Parquet:\n```python\ndf1.write.parquet(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/parquet-file\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Faster read and write speeds, reduced storage space due to compression, improved query performance through predicate pushdown and schema enforcement."

      "improvementExplanation": "The code writes data to a CSV file. While LZ4 compression is used, CSV still lacks the efficiency of columnar formats like Parquet or ORC.  Switching to Parquet or ORC will result in smaller file sizes and faster write operations.",
