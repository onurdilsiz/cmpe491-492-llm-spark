            "operation": "computeCosineSimilarity function (line 34)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `computeCosineSimilarity` function can be replaced with Spark's built-in `corr` function, which calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient between two columns. This is a more efficient and optimized approach for computing similarity scores.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "```python\nmoviePairSimilarities = moviePairRatings.mapValues(lambda ratings: corr(ratings[0], ratings[1])).cache()\n```",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with `corr` enables Catalyst optimizations, improves performance by leveraging optimized native functions, and reduces serialization overhead."

            "operation": "filterDuplicates function (line 22)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `filterDuplicates` function can be replaced with a native DataFrame/Dataset filter operation using the `>` operator. This approach is more concise and avoids the overhead of defining a separate UDF.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "```python\nuniqueJoinedRatings = joinedRatings.filter(lambda x: x[0][0] < x[0][1])\n```",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with a native filter operation improves code readability, reduces complexity, and avoids unnecessary UDF overhead."
