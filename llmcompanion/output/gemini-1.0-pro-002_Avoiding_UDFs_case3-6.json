            "operation": "The UDF is used to calculate the double of the salary column on line 104.",
            "improvementExplanation": "This UDF can be replaced with the built-in function `multiply` from the `pyspark.sql.functions` module. This function is optimized for Spark and can improve performance compared to a custom UDF.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "```python\ncustomerDF.withColumn('doublesalary', customerDF['salary'] * 2)\n```\n\nThis code snippet uses the `multiply` function to achieve the same result as the UDF.",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with a built-in function offers several benefits:\n\n* **Catalyst Optimization:** Built-in functions are optimized by Catalyst, Spark's query optimizer, which can lead to significant performance improvements.\n* **Improved Performance:** Built-in functions are generally faster than UDFs, as they are written in Scala and compiled to native code.\n* **Reduced Serialization Overhead:** UDFs require serialization and deserialization, which can add overhead to Spark jobs. Built-in functions avoid this overhead."
