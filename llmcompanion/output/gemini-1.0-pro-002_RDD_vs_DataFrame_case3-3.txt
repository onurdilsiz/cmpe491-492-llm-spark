## Analysis

The provided Spark code does not utilize RDDs. Instead, it leverages DataFrames throughout the data processing pipeline. This indicates that the code is already optimized for performance and scalability, as DataFrames offer significant advantages over RDDs in terms of:

* **Query Optimization:** DataFrames enable the use of Spark SQL, which allows for optimized query execution plans based on Catalyst Optimizer. This leads to faster and more efficient data processing.
* **Reduced Shuffling:** DataFrames minimize data shuffling between operations, as they are optimized for in-memory processing. This reduces network overhead and improves performance.
* **Better Resource Usage:** DataFrames efficiently utilize memory and CPU resources, as they are designed for columnar data storage and processing. This leads to lower resource consumption and improved scalability.

Therefore, there are no opportunities to replace RDDs with DataFrames in this code. The existing DataFrame-based approach is already well-suited for efficient and scalable data analysis.
