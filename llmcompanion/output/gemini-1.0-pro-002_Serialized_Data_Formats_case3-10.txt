      "improvementExplanation": "The current CSV format is not optimized for Spark processing. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve performance due to faster reads/writes, compression, and query optimization through predicate pushdown.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nimport pyspark.sql.functions as F\n\n# Assuming the CSV file is located at 'airport-data.csv'\nparquet_df = spark.read.parquet('airport-data.parquet')\n\n# If the Parquet file doesn't exist, convert the CSV to Parquet\nif not parquet_df.exists():\n    df = pd.read_csv('airport-data.csv')\n    parquet_df = df.toDF()\n    parquet_df.write.parquet('airport-data.parquet')\n\n# Continue using the DataFrame as before\ndf = parquet_df\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC will provide the following benefits:\n* **Faster reads/writes:** Serialized formats like Parquet and ORC are optimized for columnar storage, which allows Spark to read and write data much faster than CSV.\n* **Compression:** Parquet and ORC support compression, which can significantly reduce the size of the data on disk and improve storage efficiency.\n* **Query optimization:** Parquet and ORC allow for predicate pushdown, which means that Spark can filter data at the file level before reading it into memory. This can significantly improve query performance, especially for large datasets."
