            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to shuffle the DataFrame into 4 partitions, using the `Name` column as the partitioning key. This is likely done to improve the parallelism of subsequent operations that depend on the `Name` column. However, since the DataFrame already has 3 partitions (one for each row), using `coalesce()` instead would achieve the same level of parallelism without incurring the overhead of a full shuffle.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df.coalesce(4) # Line 23",
            "benefits": "Replacing `repartition()` with `coalesce()` in this case would avoid a full shuffle, reducing the job runtime and improving resource utilization. This is because `coalesce()` only merges partitions without redistributing data, while `repartition()` involves shuffling data across executors."
