            "improvementExplanation": "The `map` operation is used to parse each line of the text file into a list of values. This can be inefficient as it processes each line individually. Using a DataFrame/Dataset with a schema can automatically parse the data into columns, improving performance.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\n# Read the text file into a DataFrame with a schema\nemployee_df = spark.read.text(\"path/to/employees.txt\").schema(\"employee_id INT, name STRING, salary FLOAT\")\n```",
            "benefits": "Using a DataFrame/Dataset with a schema provides the following benefits:\n- **Automatic data parsing:** The schema defines the data types for each column, eliminating the need for manual parsing.\n- **Optimized query execution:** Spark can optimize queries based on the schema, improving performance.\n- **Reduced shuffling:** Data is processed in a columnar format, reducing the need to shuffle data between partitions."

            "location": "line 11",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `filter` operation is used to select employees with a salary greater than 50,000. DataFrames/Datasets provide more efficient filtering methods using SQL-like expressions.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\n# Filter employees with a salary greater than 50,000\nhigh_salary_df = employee_df.filter(employee_df.salary > 50000)\n```",
            "benefits": "Using a DataFrame/Dataset for filtering provides the following benefits:\n- **SQL-like syntax:** Filtering can be done using SQL-like expressions, making it more intuitive and readable.\n- **Optimized execution:** Spark can optimize the filtering operation based on the DataFrame/Dataset structure."

            "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\n# Calculate bonuses for high-salary employees\nbonus_df = high_salary_df.withColumn(\"bonus\", high_salary_df.salary * 1.1)\n```",
            "benefits": "Using a DataFrame/Dataset for calculations provides the following benefits:\n- **Built-in functions:** Spark provides a wide range of built-in functions for calculations, reducing the need for custom code.\n- **Vectorized operations:** Calculations are performed on entire columns at once, improving performance."
