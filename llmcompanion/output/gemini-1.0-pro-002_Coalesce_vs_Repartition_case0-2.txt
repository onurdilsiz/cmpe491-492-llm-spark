      "improvementExplanation": "The `randomSplit()` operation in Spark does not guarantee an even distribution of data across partitions. This can lead to performance issues when training a model, as some partitions may contain significantly more data than others. Using `coalesce()` before `randomSplit()` ensures that the data is evenly distributed across a smaller number of partitions, which can improve training performance.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "samples = samples.coalesce(4)\ntrain_samples,test_samples = samples.randomSplit([0.8, 0.2])",
      "benefits": "Coalescing the data before random splitting reduces the number of partitions, which can lead to:\n* Reduced shuffling during training, as there are fewer partitions to shuffle.\n* Improved resource utilization, as fewer executors are needed to process the data.\n* Faster runtime, as there is less data to process overall."
