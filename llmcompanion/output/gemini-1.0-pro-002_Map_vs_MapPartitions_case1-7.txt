**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of the `map()` transformation. Therefore, there are no opportunities to replace it with `mapPartitions()` for improved efficiency. The code primarily focuses on custom repartitioning logic using salted keys to distribute data evenly across partitions and generate files of similar size. 

While `mapPartitions()` can be beneficial for certain operations, such as batching or I/O-heavy tasks, it is not applicable in this specific code snippet. The code primarily involves data manipulation and aggregation, which are efficiently handled by the existing transformations and functions.
