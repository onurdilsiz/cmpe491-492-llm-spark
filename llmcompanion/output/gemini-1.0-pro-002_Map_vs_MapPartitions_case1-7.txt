**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of `map()` transformations. Therefore, there are no opportunities to replace them with `mapPartitions()` for improved efficiency. The code primarily focuses on data manipulation and repartitioning based on a salted key to achieve better distribution of records across HDFS files.

**Additional Notes:**

* The code utilizes functions like `withColumn()`, `groupBy()`, `agg()`, `join()`, and `repartition()` to achieve its objectives.
* The `mapPartitions()` transformation is typically beneficial when dealing with large datasets or operations that involve batching, I/O, or complex computations within partitions.
* In this specific code, the operations are primarily focused on data manipulation and aggregation, which are efficiently handled by the existing functions without requiring `mapPartitions()`.
