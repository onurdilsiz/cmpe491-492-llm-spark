            "improvementExplanation": "The current code reads data from a CSV file, which is a text-based format that is not optimized for Spark. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed and enabling columnar storage.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read data from a Parquet file\ndf = spark.read.parquet('/path/to/parquet/file')\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC would provide the following benefits:\n* **Faster reads/writes:** Serialized formats like Parquet and ORC are optimized for Spark, resulting in significantly faster read and write operations.\n* **Compression:** Parquet and ORC support compression, which reduces the storage space required for the data.\n* **Query optimization:** Parquet and ORC enable columnar storage, which allows Spark to only read the columns that are needed for a query, further improving performance.\n* **Predicate pushdown:** Parquet and ORC support predicate pushdown, which allows Spark to filter data at the file level, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed."
