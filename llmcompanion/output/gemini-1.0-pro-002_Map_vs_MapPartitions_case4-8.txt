      "operation": "URLs2domain function (line 34)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The URLs2domain function iterates over a list of URLs and applies the __URL2domain function to each element. This operation involves I/O and can be optimized by using mapPartitions instead of map. By processing the URLs in batches within each partition, we can reduce the number of function calls and improve I/O efficiency.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\n@udf(ArrayType(StringType()))\ndef URLs2domain(urls: List[str]) -> List[str]:\n    """Trims a list of URLs and leaves only the root domains."""\n    def process_partition(iterator):\n        for url in iterator:\n            yield __URL2domain(url)\n    return spark.sparkContext.parallelize(urls, numSlices=num_partitions).mapPartitions(process_partition)\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions in this case offers the following benefits:\n- Reduced function call overhead: By processing URLs in batches, we avoid calling __URL2domain for each individual URL, reducing the function call overhead.\n- Optimized I/O: Processing URLs in batches allows for more efficient I/O operations, as data can be read and processed in larger chunks.\n- Improved resource utilization: By reducing the number of function calls and optimizing I/O, mapPartitions can lead to better resource utilization and improved performance."
