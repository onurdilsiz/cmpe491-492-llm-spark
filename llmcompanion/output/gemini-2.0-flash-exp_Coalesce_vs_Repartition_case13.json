            "improvementExplanation": "The code uses `repartition(10)` to increase the number of partitions from the default to 10. Since the subsequent operation is a filter, which does not require a specific number of partitions, and the data size is small, we can reduce the number of partitions instead of increasing it. Using `coalesce()` to reduce the number of partitions will avoid a full shuffle, which is unnecessary in this case. The filter operation can be performed efficiently with fewer partitions.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "coalesced_df = sales_df.coalesce(2) # Reduce to 2 partitions, or even 1 if the data is small enough",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` reduces the amount of shuffling, as it only combines existing partitions instead of creating new ones. This leads to improved resource usage, as less data needs to be moved across the network, and faster job runtime, as the shuffle operation is a costly operation in Spark. In this specific case, since we are increasing the number of partitions with repartition, we can reduce the number of partitions with coalesce to avoid unnecessary shuffling."
