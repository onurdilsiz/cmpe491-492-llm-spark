      "location": "Line 10: `parsed_orders_rdd = orders_rdd.map(lambda line: line.split(","))`",
      "improvementExplanation": "This RDD `map` operation iterates over each line in the text file and splits it into a list, which is inefficient for structured data processing. A DataFrame can directly read the text file and infer the schema, eliminating the need for manual parsing.",

      "location": "Line 12: `electronics_orders_rdd = parsed_orders_rdd.filter(lambda order: order[3] == \"Electronics\")`",
      "improvementExplanation": "This RDD `filter` operation iterates over each order to check the category, which can be inefficient for large datasets. DataFrame's `filter` function can perform this operation more efficiently using predicate pushdown, filtering data at the storage layer.",

      "improvementExplanation": "This RDD `map` operation applies a transformation to each order individually, which can be inefficient for element-wise operations. DataFrame's `withColumn` function can perform this operation more efficiently using vectorized operations.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\ntaxed_orders_df = electronics_orders_df.withColumn(\"amount_with_tax\", electronics_orders_df.amount * 1.1)\n```",
