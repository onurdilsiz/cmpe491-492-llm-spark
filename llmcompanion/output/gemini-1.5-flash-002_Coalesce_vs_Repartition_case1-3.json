            "improvementExplanation": "The provided code uses `repartition(200)` before writing the data to CSV.  Since the purpose is to write the data, the number of partitions only affects the write operation's parallelism.  If the number of partitions in `df2` is less than 200, `repartition` will perform a full shuffle to increase the number of partitions. However, if the goal is simply to have at least 200 output files (which is likely the case here), and the current number of partitions is already greater than or equal to 200, a full shuffle is unnecessary.  `coalesce` can achieve the same outcome without the full shuffle if the current number of partitions is already greater than or equal to 200. If the number of partitions is less than 200, `coalesce` will still perform a shuffle, but it will be less expensive than `repartition` because it avoids unnecessary data movement.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df2.coalesce(200).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/coalesce/200\")",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce` can significantly reduce the shuffle time and resource consumption, leading to faster job completion.  If the number of partitions in `df2` is already greater than or equal to 200, `coalesce` will avoid the full shuffle entirely, resulting in substantial performance gains.  If the number of partitions is less than 200, the shuffle will still occur, but it will be less expensive than with `repartition`."
