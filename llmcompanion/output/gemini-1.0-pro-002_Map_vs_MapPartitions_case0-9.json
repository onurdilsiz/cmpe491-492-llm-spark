            "improvementExplanation": "This map operation simply creates a tuple with each word and a count of 1. This can be efficiently performed at the partition level using mapPartitions, which avoids unnecessary function calls for each word.",

            "benefits": "Replacing map with mapPartitions reduces function call overhead, optimizes I/O by processing data within partitions, and improves performance for this partition-level operation."

            "improvementExplanation": "This map operation swaps the key-value pair and sorts by the key. While sorting cannot be directly performed within mapPartitions, we can combine it with mapPartitions to improve efficiency. By sorting within each partition using mapPartitions, we reduce the amount of data that needs to be shuffled during the global sort.",

            "benefits": "Using mapPartitions for sorting within partitions reduces data shuffling, improves I/O efficiency, and speeds up the overall sorting process."
