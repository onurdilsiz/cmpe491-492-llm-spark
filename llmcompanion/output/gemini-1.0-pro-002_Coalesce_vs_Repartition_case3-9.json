            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition(100)` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame. However, since the subsequent operation is `coalesce(10)`, which reduces the number of partitions to 10, it is more efficient to use `coalesce(10)` directly instead of `repartition(100)`. This will avoid the unnecessary shuffle caused by `repartition(100)` and improve the overall performance.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df = df.coalesce(10)",
            "benefits": "Replacing `repartition(100)` with `coalesce(10)` will:\n- Reduce shuffling, as only a single shuffle operation is required.\n- Improve resource usage, as fewer partitions need to be processed.\n- Potentially lead to faster job runtime, as the overall shuffle operation is smaller."
