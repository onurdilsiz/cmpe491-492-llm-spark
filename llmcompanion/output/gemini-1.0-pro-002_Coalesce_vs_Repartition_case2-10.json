            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used here to shuffle the data into `m` partitions before performing the `reduceByKey()` operation. However, since the `reduceByKey()` operation only requires a shuffle within each partition, we can achieve the same result without a full shuffle by using `coalesce()` instead. This will reduce the amount of data that needs to be shuffled, leading to improved performance.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "user_basket.mapPartitions(lambda partition: find_candidate(basket=partition, sub_support=sub_support)).coalesce(m).reduceByKey(lambda a, b: min(a, b)).sortByKey().map(lambda x: (x[0])).collect()",
            "benefits": "Replacing `repartition()` with `coalesce()` in this case will:\n- Reduce the amount of data that needs to be shuffled, leading to faster job execution.\n- Improve resource utilization by avoiding unnecessary data movement.\n- Potentially reduce the overall runtime of the Spark job."
