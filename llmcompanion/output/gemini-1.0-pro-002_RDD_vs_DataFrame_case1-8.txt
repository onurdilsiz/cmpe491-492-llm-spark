## Analysis of the Provided Spark Code

The provided Spark code does not utilize RDDs. Instead, it leverages DataFrames throughout the entire workflow. This is evident from the usage of functions like `read.format("delta").load`, `randomSplit`, `select`, `summary`, `withColumn`, and `transform` with VectorAssembler and LinearRegression. These functions are all part of the DataFrame API in PySpark.

## Conclusion

The provided Spark code demonstrates efficient data processing practices by utilizing DataFrames instead of RDDs. This approach offers several advantages, including:

* **Improved performance:** DataFrames are optimized for query execution and can leverage distributed processing capabilities more effectively than RDDs.
* **Reduced shuffling:** DataFrames minimize data shuffling between operations, leading to faster execution times.
* **Better resource utilization:** DataFrames efficiently manage memory and computational resources, resulting in lower overall costs.
* **Simplified code:** DataFrames provide a more concise and readable syntax, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

Therefore, the provided code already exhibits best practices for distributed computing with Spark by leveraging DataFrames for efficient data processing.
