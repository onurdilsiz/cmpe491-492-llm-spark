      "operation": "rdd5 = rdd4.map(lambda x: (x[1],x[0])).sortByKey()",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `sortByKey()` operation requires a full shuffle to sort the data by key. Since `repartition()` is used just before `sortByKey()`, it is likely that the data is already partitioned in a way that is not optimal for sorting. Replacing `repartition()` with `coalesce()` would avoid the unnecessary shuffle and potentially improve performance.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "rdd5 = rdd4.map(lambda x: (x[1],x[0])).coalesce(rdd4.getNumPartitions()).sortByKey()",
      "benefits": "Using `coalesce()` instead of `repartition()` would reduce the amount of data shuffled, leading to improved resource usage and potentially faster job runtime."
