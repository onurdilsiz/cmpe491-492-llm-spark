      "improvementExplanation": "In this case, repartition() is used to distribute the data evenly across the specified number of workers. However, since the data is already partitioned, using coalesce() instead would achieve the same distribution without incurring the overhead of a full shuffle. This would result in reduced shuffling, improved resource usage, and faster job runtime.",
