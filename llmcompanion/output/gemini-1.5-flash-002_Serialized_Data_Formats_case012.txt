      "operation": "Reading transaction data from a text file using spark.sparkContext.textFile(\"path/to/transactions.txt\") (line 8)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads transaction data from a text file (\"path/to/transactions.txt\") using the textFile method, which is inefficient for large datasets.  Text files lack built-in compression and schema enforcement, leading to slower read times and increased storage costs. Switching to a columnar storage format like Parquet or ORC provides significant performance improvements. Parquet and ORC offer compression, schema enforcement, and support for predicate pushdown, enabling faster query execution and reduced I/O operations.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "from pyspark.sql.functions import col\n\n# Assuming transactions.parquet exists, otherwise write it first as shown below\ntransactions_df = spark.read.parquet(\"path/to/transactions.parquet\")\n\n# Filter for USD transactions\nusd_transactions_df = transactions_df.filter(col(\"currency\") == \"USD\")\nusd_transaction_count = usd_transactions_df.count()\nprint(f\"Number of USD transactions: {usd_transaction_count}\")\n\n#Writing to Parquet (if the file doesn't exist)\n# transactions_df = spark.read.csv(\"path/to/transactions.txt\", header=True, inferSchema=True)\ntransactions_df.write.parquet(\"path/to/transactions.parquet\")",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC offers several benefits:\n\n* **Faster read/write speeds:** Columnar storage allows for reading only the necessary columns, reducing I/O operations.\n* **Compression:** Parquet and ORC support various compression codecs, reducing storage space and improving read times.\n* **Schema enforcement:** Enforces data types, improving data quality and query performance.\n* **Predicate pushdown:** Enables filtering operations to be performed during the read process, further reducing I/O operations."
