            "operation": "mapPartitionsWithIndex(self.process_warcs)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `mapPartitionsWithIndex` operation iterates over partitions of the input data and applies the `process_warcs` function to each partition. This allows for batching and optimized I/O operations within each partition, potentially improving performance compared to using `map`.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "output = input_data.mapPartitionsWithIndex(self.process_warcs) \\n            .reduceByKey(self.reduce_by_key_func)",
            "benefits": "Using `mapPartitionsWithIndex` instead of `map` can provide the following benefits:\n\n* **Reduced function call overhead:** By applying the function to a batch of records within each partition, the overhead of function calls is reduced.\n* **Optimized I/O:** I/O operations can be optimized within each partition, potentially reducing the number of disk seeks and improving performance.\n* **Improved resource utilization:** By processing data in batches, resources can be utilized more efficiently."
