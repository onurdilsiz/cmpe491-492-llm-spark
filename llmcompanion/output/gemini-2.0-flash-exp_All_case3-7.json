            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a CSV file using pandas. While pandas is useful for local data manipulation, it's not optimized for distributed processing in Spark. Reading the CSV directly into a Spark DataFrame allows for parallel processing and leverages Spark's query optimization capabilities. Using a serialized format like Parquet is more efficient for storage and retrieval.",

            "benefits": "Using Parquet provides faster reads and writes, compression, and predicate pushdown, which significantly improves performance for large datasets. It also allows Spark to optimize queries more effectively."
