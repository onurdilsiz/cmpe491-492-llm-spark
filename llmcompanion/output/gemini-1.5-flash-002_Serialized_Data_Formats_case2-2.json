            "operation": "Reading tensor slice files from HDFS using `sc.binaryFiles(inputDir, numExec)` (around line 606)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads tensor slices from HDFS in binary format.  This is inefficient because it lacks built-in compression and metadata.  Switching to Parquet or ORC provides significant performance gains due to columnar storage, compression, and predicate pushdown capabilities.  Parquet is generally preferred for its wider ecosystem support and better performance in many scenarios.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"CPD-MWU\").getOrCreate()\n# Assuming your data has a schema like this (adjust as needed):\ndata = spark.read.parquet(inputDir)\n# ... rest of your code using the Spark DataFrame 'data' ...\n```",
            "benefits": "Parquet offers significant advantages:\n* **Faster Reads/Writes:** Columnar storage allows reading only necessary columns, reducing I/O.\n* **Compression:** Reduces storage space and network transfer time.\n* **Predicate Pushdown:** Spark can filter data before reading it from disk, further improving query performance.\n* **Schema Enforcement:** Ensures data consistency and integrity."

            "operation": "Saving factor matrices using `np.save(filename, Ci)` and `subprocess.call(['hadoop fs -moveFromLocal ' + './*.npy ' + outputDir], shell=True)` (around line 106)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The code saves factor matrices as individual NumPy files (.npy) and then moves them to HDFS. This approach is inefficient due to the overhead of many small files and lack of compression.  Using Parquet or ORC allows writing data in a more efficient format directly to HDFS, eliminating the intermediate step.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"CPD-MWU\").getOrCreate()\n# ... your code to generate the factor matrices ...\n# Create a DataFrame from your factor matrices\n# ... (example assuming you have a list of dictionaries)\ndata = spark.createDataFrame(your_factor_matrix_data)\n# Write the DataFrame to Parquet\ndata.write.parquet(outputDir)\n```",
            "benefits": "Parquet offers significant advantages:\n* **Faster Writes:** Data is written in a more compact format, reducing I/O.\n* **Compression:** Reduces storage space and network transfer time.\n* **Better HDFS Integration:** Direct writing to HDFS avoids the extra step of moving files."
