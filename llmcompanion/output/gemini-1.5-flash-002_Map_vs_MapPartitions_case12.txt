    {
      "operation": "sales_rdd.map(lambda row: (row[\"sale_id\"], row[\"category\"], row[\"amount\"] * 0.9))",
      "improvementExplanation": "The map operation applies a discount calculation to each row individually. This involves a function call for every single row, which can be inefficient, especially for large datasets.  mapPartitions allows processing an entire partition at once, reducing the overhead of repeated function calls and enabling potential optimizations within the partition.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "discounted_sales_rdd = sales_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: ( (row[\"sale_id\"], row[\"category\"], row[\"amount\"] * 0.9) for row in iterator))",
      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions reduces function call overhead by processing multiple rows within a partition in a single function call. This leads to improved performance, especially for CPU-bound operations.  It also allows for potential batching of operations within the partition, further enhancing efficiency."
