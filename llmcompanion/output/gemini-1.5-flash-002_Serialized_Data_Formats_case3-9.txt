      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a CSV file using pandas.  CSV is a human-readable format, but it's inefficient for large datasets in Spark due to its lack of schema enforcement and compression.  Switching to Parquet or ORC provides significant performance gains. Parquet and ORC are columnar storage formats that support compression and schema enforcement, leading to faster read/write operations and efficient query processing.  Since this is a Pandas operation, the optimization would require loading the data into a Spark DataFrame first.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"myApp\").getOrCreate()\ndf = spark.read.parquet('/Users/mac/Downloads/predictive.parquet') # Assuming data is already in Parquet format. If not, convert CSV to Parquet first.",
      "benefits": "Faster read speeds, better compression, reduced storage space, and improved query performance due to features like predicate pushdown and columnar storage."
