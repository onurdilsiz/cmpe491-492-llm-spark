      "operation": "map() operation on line 101: `rdd1 = filtered_df.rdd.map(lambda row: ','.join(str(field) for field in row))`",
      "improvementExplanation": "This map() operation iterates over each row in the RDD and applies a lambda function to convert each row into a comma-separated string. This can be inefficient for large datasets, as it involves creating a new string object for each row and incurring the overhead of function calls. Replacing this with mapPartitions() allows us to process data in batches, reducing the number of function calls and improving I/O efficiency.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\nrdd1 = filtered_df.rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: (','.join(str(field) for field in row) for row in partition))\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() offers several benefits:\n* **Reduced function call overhead:** By processing data in batches, we reduce the number of function calls, leading to improved performance.\n* **Optimized I/O:** mapPartitions() allows for more efficient I/O operations, as data can be processed in larger chunks.\n* **Improved resource utilization:** By reducing the number of function calls and optimizing I/O, mapPartitions() can lead to better resource utilization."
