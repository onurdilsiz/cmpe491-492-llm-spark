{
"operation": "filteredPaths.repartition(1)",
"improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame. However, since the DataFrame is being written to a partitioned table, the number of partitions can be reduced by using coalesce() instead. This will avoid unnecessary shuffling and improve resource utilization.",
"coalesceEquivalent": "filteredPaths.coalesce(1).write.mode('append').format('parquet').saveAsTable(dbName+\".\"+tblName, partitionBy='extract_dt', compression= 'snappy')",
"benefits": "Reduced shuffling, improved resource utilization, and faster job runtime."
