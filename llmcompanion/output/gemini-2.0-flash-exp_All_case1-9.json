            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition(1)` operation forces a full shuffle of the data to a single partition. Since the goal is to write the data to a single file, `coalesce(1)` can be used instead to avoid the full shuffle if the number of partitions is already less than or equal to the target number of partitions. This can improve performance by reducing the amount of data movement.",

Switching to Parquet will improve performance due to its columnar storage, compression, and predicate pushdown capabilities.",
