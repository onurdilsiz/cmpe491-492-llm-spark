      "improvementExplanation": "The code currently reads data from a Kinesis stream in JSON format. While JSON is human-readable, it is not efficient for large-scale data processing due to its verbose nature and lack of schema enforcement. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance, reduce storage costs, and enable predicate pushdown for query optimization. However, since the source is a Kinesis stream, we cannot directly change the input format. The optimization should be applied when writing the data to S3.",

    {
      "operation": "Writing to S3 in glueparquet format (lines 219-229)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code writes data to S3 using the `glueparquet` format, which is a variant of Parquet. This is already an optimized columnar format. While the code is already using an optimized format, it's important to ensure that the data is partitioned correctly for efficient querying. The current code partitions by year, month, and day, which is a good practice. The code also uses gzip compression, which is a good balance between compression ratio and speed. No changes are needed here.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "N/A - Already using an optimized format.",
      "benefits": "Already using an optimized format with partitioning and compression, which provides faster reads/writes, compression, and query optimization through predicate pushdown."
