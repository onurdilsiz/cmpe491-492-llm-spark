      "improvementExplanation": "The DataFrame is created using a list of strings and delimiters.  This approach lacks schema definition and relies on Spark's type inference, which can be inefficient. Using a structured format like Parquet or ORC provides schema enforcement, compression, and optimized data storage, leading to faster read/write operations and improved query performance.",
