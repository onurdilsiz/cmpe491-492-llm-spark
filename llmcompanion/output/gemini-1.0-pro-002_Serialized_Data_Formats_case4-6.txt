**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any explicit input/output operations. It primarily focuses on defining user-defined functions (UDFs) for data transformation and cleaning. These UDFs are likely to be used within a Spark DataFrame or Dataset where input/output operations would occur. However, the specific input/output operations and their locations cannot be determined without the context of how these UDFs are used within a larger Spark application.

**Additional Notes:**

* If the provided code were to be used within a Spark application that reads data from or writes data to external storage, the input/output operations would need to be identified and analyzed for potential optimization using serialized formats like Parquet or ORC.
* The benefits of using serialized formats like Parquet or ORC include faster reads/writes, compression, and query optimization through predicate pushdown. However, the specific benefits and the feasibility of switching to these formats would depend on the nature of the data, the workload, and the specific Spark application.
