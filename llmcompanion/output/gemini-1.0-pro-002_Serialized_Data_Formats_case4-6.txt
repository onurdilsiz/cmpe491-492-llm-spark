**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any explicit input/output operations. It defines several user-defined functions (UDFs) for data transformation and cleaning. These UDFs are likely to be used within a Spark DataFrame or Dataset pipeline, where input/output operations would occur. However, the specific input/output operations and data formats used are not defined in the provided code.

**Additional Notes:**

* If you provide the complete Spark DataFrame or Dataset pipeline where these UDFs are used, I can analyze the input/output operations and suggest optimizations using serialized formats like Parquet or ORC.
* It's important to consider the specific use case and data characteristics when choosing an optimized data format. Parquet and ORC offer advantages in terms of performance and compression, but they may not be suitable for all scenarios.
