            "operation": "spark.read.csv(loc_data, header=True) at line 70",
            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads location data from a CSV file.  CSV is a text-based format, leading to slower read times and larger file sizes compared to binary formats like Parquet or ORC. Parquet and ORC offer better compression, faster read/write speeds, and support for schema enforcement and predicate pushdown, significantly improving query performance.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "df_loc = spark.read.parquet(loc_data)",
            "benefits": "Faster read speeds, smaller file sizes due to compression, schema enforcement, and potential for predicate pushdown leading to faster query execution."

            "operation": "spark.read.csv(hvl_data, header=True) at line 92",
            "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the previous case, reading from a CSV is inefficient. Switching to Parquet or ORC will improve performance.",

            "operation": "spark.read.csv(weather_data, header=True, inferSchema=True) at line 142",
            "improvementExplanation": "Reading multiple CSV weather files is inefficient.  Parquet or ORC would provide significant performance gains by consolidating data and enabling faster processing.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "weather_df = spark.read.parquet(weather_data)",
            "benefits": "Faster read speeds, smaller file sizes due to compression, schema enforcement, and potential for predicate pushdown leading to faster query execution.  Consolidating multiple files into a single Parquet file improves overall efficiency."

            "improvementExplanation": "While the code writes to Parquet, the input data is read from CSV.  The entire process would benefit from using Parquet for both input and output.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "No change needed; already using Parquet.  However, consider using ORC for potential further performance improvements.",
            "benefits": "Parquet already provides faster write speeds, better compression, and schema enforcement. ORC might offer additional performance benefits depending on the data characteristics."

            "improvementExplanation": "The code writes to Parquet, which is efficient. However, the input data is read from Parquet files.  Optimizations could focus on improving the data processing steps within the function rather than the I/O format.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "No change needed; already using Parquet. Consider optimizing data processing steps within the function for further performance improvements.",
            "benefits": "Parquet already provides efficient write operations, compression, and partitioning for faster query performance.  Further optimizations should focus on the data processing logic."
