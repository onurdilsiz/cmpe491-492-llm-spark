            "improvementExplanation": "The `map` operation is used to convert each dictionary in the `json_rdd` RDD to a `Row` object. This operation is performed on each element individually, which can be inefficient. Since the conversion from dictionary to `Row` is a simple operation that doesn't involve external I/O or complex computations, it's suitable for batch processing within a partition.  Using `mapPartitions` allows Spark to process multiple dictionaries within a partition at once, reducing the overhead of repeatedly calling the `lambda` function for each individual element.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "json_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: [Row(**x) for x in iterator])",
            "benefits": "Switching to `mapPartitions` reduces the function call overhead by processing multiple elements within a partition in a single batch. This leads to improved performance, especially when dealing with a large number of elements.  It also reduces the communication overhead between the driver and executors."
