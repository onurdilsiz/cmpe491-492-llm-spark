            "operation": "Reading data from a text file using spark.sparkContext.textFile(input_file) at line 16.",
            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a text file ('numbers.txt' or a file specified via command-line argument).  Text files are not optimized for Spark processing. They lack features like columnar storage, compression, and metadata that can significantly speed up data loading and query execution. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC will improve performance by enabling predicate pushdown, reducing I/O operations, and providing better compression.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "Assuming the data in 'numbers.txt' can be represented as a single column, we can convert it to Parquet:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nimport sys\n\ninput_file = sys.argv[1]\n\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"Quiz3\").getOrCreate()\n\ndf = spark.read.text(input_file)\ndf = df.withColumnRenamed(\"value\", \"number\")\ndf.write.parquet(\"numbers.parquet\")\n\n#Later, read the Parquet file:\nparquet_df = spark.read.parquet(\"numbers.parquet\")\n\n#Continue with your processing using parquet_df\n```\n\nFor more complex data structures, you would need to adjust the schema accordingly when writing to Parquet.",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet offers several benefits:\n\n* **Faster Reads/Writes:** Parquet's columnar storage allows reading only the necessary columns, significantly reducing I/O operations.\n* **Compression:** Parquet supports various compression codecs, reducing storage space and improving read/write speeds.\n* **Predicate Pushdown:** Query filters can be applied directly to the Parquet files, reducing the amount of data processed by Spark.\n* **Schema Enforcement:** Parquet enforces schema, improving data quality and reducing errors."
