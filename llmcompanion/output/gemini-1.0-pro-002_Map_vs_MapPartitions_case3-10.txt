    {
      "operation": "map() is used on line 44 to transform the input values from the string indexer.",
      "improvementExplanation": "The transformation involves applying the indexer to each row individually. This can be inefficient as it incurs function call overhead for each row. By using mapPartitions(), we can process the data in batches, reducing the number of function calls and potentially improving performance.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\npred_row = pred_row.rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: indexer.transform(partition))\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() can provide the following benefits:\n\n* **Reduced function call overhead:** By processing data in batches, we reduce the number of function calls to the indexer, leading to improved performance.\n* **Optimized I/O:** Batching can also optimize I/O operations, as data can be read and processed in larger chunks.\n* **Improved resource utilization:** By reducing function call overhead and optimizing I/O, mapPartitions() can lead to better resource utilization."
