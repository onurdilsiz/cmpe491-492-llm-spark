      "operation": "The map() operation is used on line 54 to transform the input values from the string indexer.",
      "improvementExplanation": "In this case, the map() operation is applied to each row of the DataFrame individually. However, since the string indexer transformation is a batch operation that can be applied to multiple rows at once, it can be more efficient to use mapPartitions() instead. This will reduce the number of function calls and improve the overall performance of the transformation.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\npred_row = pred_row.rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: indexer.transform(partition))\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() in this case will provide the following benefits:\n\n* **Reduced function call overhead:** By applying the transformation to multiple rows at once, we can reduce the number of function calls to the string indexer, which can improve performance.\n* **Optimized I/O:** mapPartitions() can potentially optimize I/O operations by reading and writing data in larger chunks, which can be more efficient than reading and writing individual rows.\n* **Improved resource utilization:** By processing data in larger batches, we can improve the utilization of resources such as CPU and memory."
