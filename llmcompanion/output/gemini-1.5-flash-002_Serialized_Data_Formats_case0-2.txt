      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a text file ('spam.txt').  Text files are not optimized for Spark processing.  They lack schema information, leading to inefficient parsing and lack of compression. Switching to Parquet or ORC provides schema enforcement, compression, and efficient columnar storage, resulting in faster read times and reduced storage space.",

      "benefits": "Faster read speeds, reduced storage space due to compression, and improved query performance through predicate pushdown and schema enforcement."
