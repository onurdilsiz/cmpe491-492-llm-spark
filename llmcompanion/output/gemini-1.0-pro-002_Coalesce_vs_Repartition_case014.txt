    {
      "operation": "transactions_df.repartition(10)  # Unnecessary repartition",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame to 10. However, this is unnecessary in this case because the DataFrame is already partitioned by the `category` column. Using `coalesce()` instead would reduce the number of partitions to the minimum required, which is 1, without performing a full shuffle.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "transactions_df.coalesce(1)",
      "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` would reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and potentially speed up the job runtime."
