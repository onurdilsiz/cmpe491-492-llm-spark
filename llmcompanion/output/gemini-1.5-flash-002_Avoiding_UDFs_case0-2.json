            "improvementExplanation": "The lambda functions used in flatMap are simple string splitting operations.  Spark's built-in `split()` function can directly operate on RDDs of strings, eliminating the need for a UDF.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "spam_words = spam_rdd.flatMap(lambda x: x.split(' ')) \nnon_spam_words = non_spam_rdd.flatMap(lambda x: x.split(' '))",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDFs with the built-in `split()` function allows Spark's optimizer to push down the operation, improving performance and reducing the overhead of UDF serialization and execution."

            "improvementExplanation": "These lambda functions create LabeledPoint objects. While not strictly UDFs in the traditional sense, they represent custom logic within a transformation.  This can be improved by using a more efficient approach.",

            "benefits": "This minor change doesn't drastically alter performance but promotes cleaner code and better readability.  It avoids unnecessary lambda function overhead."
