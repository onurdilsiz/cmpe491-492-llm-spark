            "improvementExplanation": "The current code reads data from a text file, which is an inefficient format for Spark processing. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve performance due to:\n\n* **Faster reads/writes:** Serialized formats are optimized for reading and writing large datasets, resulting in faster data loading and processing times.\n* **Compression:** Serialized formats compress data efficiently, reducing storage requirements and network transfer times.\n* **Query optimization:** Serialized formats support predicate pushdown, allowing Spark to filter data before reading it, further improving query performance.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read data from Parquet file\ndata = sc.read.parquet(\"data-2.parquet\")\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC would provide the following benefits:\n\n* **Faster data processing:** Reduced data loading and processing times due to optimized reads/writes.\n* **Reduced storage requirements:** Efficient data compression leading to lower storage costs.\n* **Improved query performance:** Faster query execution through predicate pushdown."
