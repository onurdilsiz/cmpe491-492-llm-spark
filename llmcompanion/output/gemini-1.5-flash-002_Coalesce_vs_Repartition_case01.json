            "improvementExplanation": "The code uses `repartition(10)` to increase the number of partitions to 10 before writing the DataFrame.  This forces a full shuffle, even if the current number of partitions is less than 10. Since the goal is likely to write the data to a file system, and the number of partitions is not critical for the write operation itself, using `coalesce` would avoid unnecessary shuffling if the current number of partitions is already less than or equal to 10.  `coalesce` only shuffles data if the target number of partitions is greater than the current number.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "repartitioned_df = electronics_sales_df.coalesce(10)",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce(10)` avoids unnecessary data shuffling if the initial number of partitions is less than or equal to 10. This leads to reduced network traffic, lower resource consumption (CPU and memory), and faster job completion time."
