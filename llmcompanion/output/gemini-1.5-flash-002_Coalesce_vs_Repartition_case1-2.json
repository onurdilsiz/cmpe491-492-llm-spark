            "improvementExplanation": "The provided code uses `repartition(1)` before writing the data to a CSV file.  Since the goal is to write the data to a single file, using `repartition(1)` causes a full shuffle of the data, which is unnecessary.  `coalesce(1)` can achieve the same result without the full shuffle.  `coalesce` only reduces the number of partitions; if the number of partitions is already less than or equal to the target number of partitions, it does not perform a shuffle. In this case, it's likely that the number of partitions is greater than 1, so `coalesce` will be more efficient.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df2.coalesce(1).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/coalesce/1\")",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce(1)` avoids a full data shuffle, resulting in significantly reduced execution time and resource consumption.  The job will complete faster and use less network bandwidth and CPU resources."
