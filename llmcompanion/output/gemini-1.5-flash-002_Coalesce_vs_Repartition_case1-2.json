            "improvementExplanation": "The provided code uses `repartition(1)` before writing the data to a CSV file.  Since the goal is to write the data to a single file, using `repartition(1)` causes a full shuffle, which is unnecessary.  `coalesce(1)` achieves the same result (one output file) without the full shuffle.  `coalesce` will try to reduce the number of partitions without shuffling if possible, making it more efficient when the number of partitions is already less than or equal to the target number of partitions.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df2.coalesce(1).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/coalesce/1\")",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce(1)` avoids a full data shuffle, resulting in significantly reduced execution time and resource consumption.  The job will complete faster and use less network bandwidth and CPU resources."
