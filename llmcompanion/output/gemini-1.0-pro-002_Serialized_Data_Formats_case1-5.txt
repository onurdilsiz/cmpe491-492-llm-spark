      "operation": "Reading data from a text file (line 10)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a text file, which is an inefficient format for large datasets. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance due to columnar storage, compression, and optimized data structures.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\ndf1 = spark.read.parquet(\"hdfs://namenode/user/controller/ncdc-orig/2000-2018.parquet\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC would provide the following benefits:\n- **Faster reads:** Columnar storage allows for efficient data access by only reading the required columns, reducing I/O operations.\n- **Compression:** Parquet and ORC use efficient compression algorithms, reducing storage space and network transfer times.\n- **Query optimization:** Predicate pushdown allows filtering data at the file level, further improving query performance."
