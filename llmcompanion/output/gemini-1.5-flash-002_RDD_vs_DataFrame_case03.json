            "improvementExplanation": "This RDD map operation performs string splitting on each line of the input file.  This is inefficient because it's done in a distributed manner without leveraging Spark's optimized data processing capabilities. DataFrames provide built-in schema enforcement and optimized data processing.",

            "benefits": "Using DataFrames for this operation offers significant performance improvements. DataFrames leverage Spark's Catalyst optimizer, which performs query planning and optimization. This leads to reduced data shuffling, improved execution plans, and better resource utilization.  The schema enforcement in DataFrames also enhances data integrity."

            "rddOperation": "department_salary_rdd.map(lambda emp: (emp[2], float(emp[3]))) (line 13)",
            "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the previous RDD map, this operation processes data inefficiently.  It's a distributed operation on an RDD, which lacks the optimization capabilities of DataFrames.",

            "benefits": "Switching to DataFrames eliminates the need for this RDD map.  DataFrames provide built-in functions for type casting and column selection, which are optimized for distributed processing. This results in faster execution, reduced resource consumption, and improved scalability."
