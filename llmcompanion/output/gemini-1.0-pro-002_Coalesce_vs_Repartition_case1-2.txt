      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used here to write the DataFrame to a CSV file with a single partition. However, since the DataFrame is already partitioned by `Weather_Station`, we can use `coalesce()` instead to reduce the number of partitions without shuffling the data. This will improve the efficiency of the write operation by reducing the number of files that need to be written.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "df2.coalesce(1).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/repartition/1\")",
      "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` in this case will reduce the amount of shuffling required, improve resource usage, and potentially speed up the job runtime."
