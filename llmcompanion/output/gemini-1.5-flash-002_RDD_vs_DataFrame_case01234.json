            "improvementExplanation": "The RDD `map` operation processes each element individually.  DataFrames provide optimized execution plans and can leverage Catalyst optimizer for better performance.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "data = spark.read.csv('path/to/data.csv', header=False, inferSchema=True)\ndata.withColumn('id', data['_c0'].cast('int')).withColumn('name', data['_c1'].upper()).show()",
            "benefits": "DataFrames offer significant performance improvements over RDDs for this operation due to optimized execution plans and parallel processing capabilities.  Catalyst optimizer can further enhance performance by applying various optimizations."

            "rddOperation": "repartitioned_df = df.repartition(10) (line 16)",
            "improvementExplanation": "Using `repartition` can lead to significant data shuffling, especially with a large number of partitions.  For many operations, it's more efficient to work with the existing partition scheme.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "No direct equivalent needed.  If repartitioning is truly necessary, consider using `coalesce` for reducing partitions or adjusting the initial number of partitions during DataFrame creation.",
            "benefits": "Avoiding unnecessary `repartition` calls reduces data shuffling, improving performance and resource utilization. `coalesce` is preferred for reducing partitions as it avoids unnecessary shuffling."

            "rddOperation": "mapped_rdd = rdd.map(lambda line: int(line.split(',')[0]) * 2) (line 20)",
            "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the first case, using RDD `map` is less efficient than DataFrame operations. DataFrames can perform this operation using built-in functions or UDFs with optimized execution plans.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "data = spark.read.csv('path/to/data.csv', header=False, inferSchema=True)\ndata.withColumn('id', data['_c0'].cast('int')).withColumn('doubled_id', col('id') * 2).show()",
            "benefits": "DataFrames provide optimized execution plans and parallel processing, leading to faster execution and better resource utilization compared to RDD `map`."
