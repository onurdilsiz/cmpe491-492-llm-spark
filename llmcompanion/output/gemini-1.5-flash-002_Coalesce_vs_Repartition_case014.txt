      "operation": "repartitioned_df = transactions_df.repartition(10)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code uses `repartition(10)` after creating the `transactions_df` DataFrame.  This forces a full shuffle of the data across 10 partitions, regardless of the initial number of partitions in `transactions_df`. If the goal is simply to reduce the number of partitions, and the initial number of partitions is greater than 10, `coalesce()` can be used instead. `coalesce()` avoids a full shuffle if the target number of partitions is less than or equal to the current number of partitions.  It only performs a partial shuffle if necessary.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "repartitioned_df = transactions_df.coalesce(10)",
      "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce(10)` offers significant performance benefits. If the initial number of partitions in `transactions_df` is greater than 10, `coalesce` will reduce the number of partitions without a full data shuffle, resulting in faster execution and reduced resource consumption. If the initial number of partitions is less than or equal to 10, `coalesce` will not perform any shuffle at all.  This avoids the unnecessary overhead of a full shuffle introduced by `repartition()`."
