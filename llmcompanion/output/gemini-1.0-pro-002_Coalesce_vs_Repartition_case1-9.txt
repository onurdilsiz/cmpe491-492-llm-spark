      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions to 1. However, since the subsequent operation is `write.mode('append').format('parquet').saveAsTable()`, which does not involve shuffling data, we can use `coalesce()` instead to reduce the number of partitions to 1 without incurring the overhead of a full shuffle. This will improve resource utilization and potentially speed up the job execution.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "filteredPaths.coalesce(1).write.mode('append').format('parquet').saveAsTable(dbName+\".\"+tblName, partitionBy='extract_dt', compression= 'snappy')",
      "benefits": "Replacing `repartition()` with `coalesce()` in this case will:\n- Reduce shuffling overhead, as `coalesce()` only moves data within existing partitions.\n- Improve resource utilization by reducing the number of partitions.\n- Potentially speed up the job execution by avoiding unnecessary data movement."
