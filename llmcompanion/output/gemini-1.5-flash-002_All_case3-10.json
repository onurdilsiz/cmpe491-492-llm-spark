Pandas loads the entire CSV into the driver's memory, which can cause out-of-memory errors for large datasets.  Spark's DataFrame API provides optimized methods for reading and processing large datasets in a distributed manner.  Using a columnar storage format like Parquet or ORC further improves performance by enabling efficient data compression and predicate pushdown.",
