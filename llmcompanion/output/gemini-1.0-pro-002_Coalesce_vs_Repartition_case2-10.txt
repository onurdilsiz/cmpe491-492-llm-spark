      "operation": "repartition() is used in the code at line 104.",
      "improvementExplanation": "In this case, repartition() is used to increase the number of partitions from the default value of 3 to the specified value of m. However, since the subsequent operations (reduceByKey, sortBy, map) do not require a full shuffle, using coalesce() instead would be more efficient. Coalesce() will simply merge the existing partitions without shuffling the data, resulting in reduced shuffling overhead and potentially faster execution.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "user_basket.coalesce(m)",
      "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() in this case would reduce shuffling overhead, improve resource usage, and potentially lead to a faster runtime."
