      "operation": "Reading CSV file into a DataFrame at line 81: `customerDF = spark.read.csv(\"retailstore.csv\",header=True)`",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a CSV file, which is a text-based format.  CSV files are not optimized for Spark's distributed processing.  They lack features like columnar storage, compression, and metadata, leading to slower read times and increased network traffic. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC significantly improves performance by enabling predicate pushdown, efficient data compression, and faster read/write operations. Parquet and ORC also support schema evolution, making them more robust for evolving datasets.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "customerDF = spark.read.parquet(\"retailstore.parquet\")\n# Or\ncustomerDF = spark.read.orc(\"retailstore.orc\")\n# Note: This requires saving the data in Parquet or ORC format beforehand using:\n# customerDF.write.parquet(\"retailstore.parquet\")\n# customerDF.write.orc(\"retailstore.orc\")",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC offers several benefits:\n* **Faster read/write speeds:** Columnar storage allows Spark to read only the necessary columns, reducing I/O operations.\n* **Improved compression:** Parquet and ORC provide efficient compression, reducing storage space and network transfer times.\n* **Predicate pushdown:** The optimizer can push down filters to the data source, reducing the amount of data processed.\n* **Schema evolution:**  Handles changes in data schema more gracefully."
