            "improvementExplanation": "The `map` operation is used to convert each line of text into a list of floats. This can be done more efficiently using the DataFrame API's `selectExpr` method, which allows for vectorized operations on columns.",

            "benefits": "Using `selectExpr` can significantly improve performance by avoiding the overhead of creating a new RDD for each line of text. It also allows for better resource utilization by performing the operation in a vectorized manner."
