      "improvementExplanation": "The code uses `agg_df.collect()` to bring all the data to the driver and then iterates over it to find the maximum value. This is an RDD operation and can be replaced with a DataFrame operation to avoid collecting all data to the driver. Instead of collecting the data, we can use the `agg` function with `max` to find the maximum value in a distributed manner.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "number_of_files = agg_df.agg(F.max('_num')).collect()[0][0]",
      "benefits": "Avoids collecting all data to the driver, enabling distributed computation, and improving performance for large datasets."

    {
      "operation": "df = df.repartition(number_of_files, '_salted_key')",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code uses `repartition` which always performs a full shuffle. Since the goal is to reduce the number of partitions to `number_of_files` after the salting, we can use `coalesce` instead of `repartition` if `number_of_files` is less than the current number of partitions. This will avoid a full shuffle and improve performance.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "df = df.coalesce(number_of_files)",
      "benefits": "Reduces shuffling, improves resource usage, and results in faster job runtime by avoiding a full shuffle."
