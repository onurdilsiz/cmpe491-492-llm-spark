      "operation": "ratings = data.map(lambda l: l.split()).map(lambda l: (int(l[0]), (int(l[1]), float(l[2]))))",
      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation processes each line individually.  Since the split and type conversion operations are independent for each line, they can be performed within a partition without inter-partition communication. Using mapPartitions allows for batch processing of lines within each partition, reducing the overhead of repeatedly calling the lambda function for each line.",

      "operation": "moviePairs = uniqueJoinedRatings.map(makePairs)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The makePairs function transforms each element of the RDD.  This transformation is independent for each element and can be done within a partition. Using mapPartitions allows for batch processing of elements within each partition, reducing the overhead of repeatedly calling the makePairs function for each element.",

      "improvementExplanation": "The computeCosineSimilarity function processes each value associated with a key.  This operation can be performed on multiple values within a partition. Using mapPartitions allows for batch processing of values within each partition, reducing the overhead of repeatedly calling the computeCosineSimilarity function for each value.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "moviePairSimilarities = moviePairRatings.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: ( (k, computeCosineSimilarity(list(v))) for k, v in iterator ))",

      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation is applied after a filter and before a sort. The transformation is independent for each element and can be done within a partition. Using mapPartitions allows for batch processing of elements within each partition, reducing the overhead of repeatedly calling the lambda function for each element. However, the benefit might be marginal due to the subsequent sortByKey operation which shuffles data across partitions.",
