**Explanation:**

After analyzing the provided Spark code, I did not detect any instances where User-Defined Functions (UDFs) are used. The code relies on built-in Spark functions and native DataFrame/Dataset operations for data processing.

**Benefits of Avoiding UDFs:**

While UDFs can be useful for extending Spark's functionality, they can also introduce performance overhead and hinder Catalyst optimizations. By avoiding UDFs and leveraging built-in functions and transformations, the code can benefit from:

- **Improved Performance:** Built-in functions and transformations are often optimized for performance, leading to faster execution times.
- **Catalyst Optimizations:** Spark's Catalyst optimizer can effectively optimize queries that use built-in functions, resulting in more efficient execution plans.
- **Reduced Serialization Overhead:** UDFs require serialization and deserialization, which can add overhead to data processing. Avoiding UDFs can reduce this overhead.

**Conclusion:**

The provided Spark code effectively utilizes built-in functions and native DataFrame/Dataset operations, avoiding the potential drawbacks of UDFs. This approach contributes to improved performance, efficient query optimization, and reduced serialization overhead.
