      "improvementExplanation": "The current `repartition()` operation is used to distribute the DataFrame into a specific number of partitions based on a salted key. However, since the goal is to create files of a certain size, using `coalesce()` instead would achieve the same outcome without requiring a full shuffle. `coalesce()` simply reduces the number of partitions without changing the data distribution, which is sufficient for this scenario.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "df = df.coalesce(number_of_files)\n            .drop('_salted_key')",
      "benefits": "Replacing `repartition()` with `coalesce()` offers several benefits:\n\n* **Reduced shuffling:** `coalesce()` avoids the need to shuffle data across the cluster, leading to faster execution times.\n* **Improved resource usage:** By reducing the number of partitions, `coalesce()` minimizes the memory and CPU resources required for the operation.\n* **Faster runtime:** The overall job runtime can be significantly improved by eliminating the shuffling overhead associated with `repartition()`."
