            "operation": "Reading text data from HDFS using `spark.read.text()` at line 14.",
            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a text file in HDFS.  Text files are not optimized for Spark processing.  They lack schema information, leading to increased processing overhead during data parsing and transformation.  Switching to Parquet or ORC provides schema enforcement, efficient columnar storage, and built-in compression, resulting in faster read times and reduced storage space.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\ndf1 = spark.read.parquet(\"hdfs://namenode/user/controller/ncdc-orig/2000-2018.parquet\")\n```\n\nNote: This assumes the data has been pre-processed and saved as a Parquet file.  A conversion step would be needed if the original data remains in text format.",
            "benefits": "Faster read speeds, reduced storage space, schema enforcement, and improved query performance due to predicate pushdown."

            "improvementExplanation": "The code writes data to a CSV file with LZ4 compression. While LZ4 provides some compression, Parquet or ORC offer significantly better compression ratios and faster read/write performance due to their columnar storage and efficient encoding schemes.  Furthermore, Parquet and ORC support predicate pushdown, enabling Spark to filter data before reading it entirely, leading to substantial performance gains for large datasets.",

            "benefits": "Significantly faster write speeds, better compression ratios leading to reduced storage space, and improved query performance due to predicate pushdown.  Parquet also offers better support for complex data types."
