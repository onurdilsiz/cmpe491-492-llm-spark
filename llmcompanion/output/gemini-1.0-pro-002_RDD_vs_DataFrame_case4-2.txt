**Explanation:**

The provided code snippet does not involve any RDD operations. It exclusively utilizes DataFrames for data manipulation and analysis. Therefore, there are no opportunities to replace RDDs with DataFrames for performance enhancement.

**Key Observations:**

- The code creates a DataFrame `df` using the `create_standard_df()` function.
- It defines a UDF (User-Defined Function) `new_salary` to calculate the total salary based on existing salary and bonus.
- The UDF is registered with Spark SQL and used to add a new column `new_salary` to the DataFrame.
- Finally, the code creates a temporary view `emps` from the DataFrame and executes a SQL query to calculate and display the `salary_total`.

**Conclusion:**

The provided code effectively leverages DataFrames for data processing, demonstrating an efficient approach to data analysis in Spark. As there are no RDD operations present, no replacements are necessary.
