    {
      "operation": "Reading text files using `sc.textFile()` (lines 10 and 11)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current code reads text files using `sc.textFile()`, which is inefficient for large datasets. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve performance due to faster reads/writes, compression, and query optimization through predicate pushdown.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Load the datasets into Parquet files\nspam_df = spark.read.parquet(file_path_spam)\nnon_spam_df = spark.read.parquet(file_path_non_spam)\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC would provide the following benefits:\n* **Faster reads/writes:** Serialized formats like Parquet and ORC are optimized for efficient data storage and retrieval, leading to faster read and write operations.\n* **Compression:** These formats compress data efficiently, reducing storage requirements and network transfer times.\n* **Query optimization:** Parquet and ORC support predicate pushdown, which allows filtering data at the storage layer, further improving query performance."
    },
    {
      "operation": "Saving the model using `model.save()` (line 32)",
      "improvementExplanation": "While not directly related to input/output operations, saving the model in a serialized format like Parquet or PMML can improve portability and efficiency.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Save the model in Parquet format\nmodel.save('spam_model.parquet')\n```",
      "benefits": "Saving the model in a serialized format provides the following benefits:\n* **Portability:** Serialized formats like Parquet and PMML are platform-independent, making it easier to share and deploy the model across different environments.\n* **Efficiency:** Serialized formats are more compact and efficient than plain text formats, reducing storage requirements and loading times."
