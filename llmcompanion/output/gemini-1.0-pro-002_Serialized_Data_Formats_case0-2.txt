      "operation": "Reading text files (CSV format) - Line 10 and 11",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current code reads email messages from text files (CSV format). This format is not optimized for Spark processing, as it requires parsing and deserialization for each line. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve performance by reducing the overhead of parsing and deserialization.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Load the datasets into RDDs\nspam_rdd = sc.textFile(file_path_spam)\nnon_spam_rdd = sc.textFile(file_path_non_spam)\n\n# Convert text files to Parquet format\nspam_rdd.saveAsParquetFile(\"spam.parquet\")\nnon_spam_rdd.saveAsParquetFile(\"non_spam.parquet\")\n\n# Load Parquet files into RDDs\nspam_rdd = sc.read.parquet(\"spam.parquet\")\nnon_spam_rdd = sc.read.parquet(\"non_spam.parquet\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC would provide the following benefits:\n* **Faster reads/writes:** Parquet and ORC are columnar formats that allow for efficient data access and filtering, resulting in faster read and write operations.\n* **Compression:** Parquet and ORC support compression, which can significantly reduce storage space requirements.\n* **Query optimization:** Parquet and ORC enable predicate pushdown, where filters are applied directly on the compressed data, further improving query performance."
