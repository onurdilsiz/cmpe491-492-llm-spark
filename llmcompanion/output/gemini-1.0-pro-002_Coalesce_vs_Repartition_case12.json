            "operation": "sales_df.repartition(10)  # Unnecessary shuffle when reducing partitions",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame. However, in this case, the goal is to reduce the number of partitions. Therefore, using `coalesce()` instead would be more efficient as it avoids unnecessary shuffling of data.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "sales_df.coalesce(10)",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` in this case would provide the following benefits:\n- Reduced shuffling: `coalesce()` avoids unnecessary data movement compared to `repartition()`, leading to faster job execution.\n- Improved resource usage: By reducing the number of partitions, `coalesce()` can help optimize resource utilization within the cluster.\n- Faster runtime: The overall job runtime can be improved due to reduced shuffling and efficient resource usage."
