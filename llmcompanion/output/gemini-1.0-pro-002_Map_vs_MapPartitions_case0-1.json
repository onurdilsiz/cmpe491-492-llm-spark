            "improvementExplanation": "This map operation splits each line of the input data into a list of tokens and then extracts the user ID, movie ID, and rating. This transformation involves splitting strings and converting data types, which can be computationally expensive. By using mapPartitions instead, we can process multiple lines of data at once, reducing the number of function calls and improving efficiency.",

            "benefits": "Using mapPartitions reduces function call overhead, optimizes I/O by processing data in batches, and improves resource utilization by minimizing data shuffling."
