            "improvementExplanation": "This map operation splits each line of the input data and then extracts the user ID, movie ID, and rating. This transformation can be performed more efficiently using mapPartitions() because it allows processing multiple lines of data at once, reducing the number of function calls and improving I/O performance.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\nratings = data.mapPartitions(lambda partition: (\n    for line in partition:\n        fields = line.split()\n        yield (int(fields[0]), (int(fields[1]), float(fields[2])))\n))\n```",
            "benefits": "Replacing map() with mapPartitions() in this case offers several benefits:\n- **Reduced function call overhead:** Processing data in batches reduces the number of function calls, leading to improved performance.\n- **Optimized I/O:** Reading and processing data in larger chunks improves I/O efficiency.\n- **Improved resource utilization:** Batch processing reduces the memory footprint and CPU usage, allowing for more efficient resource utilization."

            "improvementExplanation": "This map operation computes the cosine similarity for each pair of movies. This transformation can also be performed more efficiently using mapPartitions() because it allows calculating similarities for multiple movie pairs within a partition, reducing function call overhead and improving performance.",
