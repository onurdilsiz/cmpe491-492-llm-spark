            "improvementExplanation": "This map() operation splits each line of the input data into a list of tokens and then extracts the user ID, movie ID, and rating from the tokens. This operation can be performed more efficiently using mapPartitions() because it allows us to process multiple lines of data at once, reducing the number of function calls and improving I/O performance.",

            "benefits": "Replacing map() with mapPartitions() in this case can significantly improve performance by reducing function call overhead, optimizing I/O, and improving resource utilization."
