      "improvementExplanation": "The RDD operations mapPartitions and reduceByKey are used for grouping points into cells and counting points per cell.  DataFrames provide optimized groupBy and count aggregations, which are significantly faster and more efficient than RDD-based operations.",

      "benefits": "DataFrames leverage Catalyst optimizer for query planning and execution, resulting in reduced shuffling, improved resource utilization, and faster execution times compared to RDD-based mapPartitions and reduceByKey.  The DataFrame approach also benefits from columnar storage and optimized execution plans."
