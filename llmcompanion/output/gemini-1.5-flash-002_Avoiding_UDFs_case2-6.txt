    {
      "operation": "def word2vec(word):\n    return model[word.lower()]",
      "improvementExplanation": "This UDF converts a word to its word2vec vector representation.  This can be replaced by a broadcast variable and a lookup operation within a Spark SQL expression or a map transformation.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "First, broadcast the `model` variable: \n```python\nbroadcast_model = sc.broadcast(model)\n```\nThen, use it within a map transformation or Spark SQL expression:\n```python\ndata_rdd = data_rdd.map(lambda x: broadcast_model.value[x.lower()])\n```\nOr, within a Spark SQL expression if your data is in a DataFrame:\n```sql\nSELECT model[lower(word)] FROM data_table\n```",
      "benefits": "Using a broadcast variable avoids repeated serialization of the model to each executor, improving performance.  Integrating with Spark SQL enables Catalyst optimizations."
