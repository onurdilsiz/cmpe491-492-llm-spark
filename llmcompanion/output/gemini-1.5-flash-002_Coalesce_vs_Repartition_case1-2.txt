      "improvementExplanation": "The provided code uses `repartition(1)` before writing the data to a CSV file.  Since the goal is to write the data to a single file, using `repartition(1)` performs a full shuffle, which is unnecessary.  `coalesce(1)` achieves the same outcome (one output file) without the full shuffle, resulting in significant performance gains, especially for large datasets.  `coalesce` will try to reduce the number of partitions without shuffling if possible. If the current number of partitions is already less than the target, it will not perform any shuffle.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "df2.coalesce(1).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/coalesce/1\")",
      "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce(1)` avoids a full data shuffle, leading to reduced execution time, lower resource consumption (CPU and network), and improved overall job performance.  The primary benefit is the avoidance of unnecessary data movement."
