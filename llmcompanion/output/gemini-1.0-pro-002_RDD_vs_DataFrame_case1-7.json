            "improvementExplanation": "The code creates an RDD from a DataFrame in the `custom_repartitioner` function. This can be inefficient as RDDs are less optimized for data processing compared to DataFrames.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "Instead of creating an RDD, the code can directly use DataFrame transformations and actions. For example, the `agg` and `join` operations can be performed directly on the DataFrame.",
