            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a CSV file. CSV is a text-based format, which is not efficient for large datasets. It lacks schema information, requires parsing on every read, and does not support compression or predicate pushdown. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve performance by enabling faster reads, compression, and query optimization.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read the CSV file\ncustomerDF = spark.read.csv(\"retailstore.csv\",header=True)\n\n# Write to Parquet format\ncustomerDF.write.parquet(\"retailstore.parquet\")\n\n# Read from Parquet format\ncustomerDF_parquet = spark.read.parquet(\"retailstore.parquet\")\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet offers several benefits:\n- **Faster Reads:** Parquet is a columnar format, allowing Spark to read only the necessary columns for a query, reducing I/O.\n- **Compression:** Parquet supports efficient compression algorithms, reducing storage space and I/O.\n- **Schema Evolution:** Parquet stores schema information, eliminating the need for schema inference on every read.\n- **Predicate Pushdown:** Parquet allows Spark to push down filters to the data source, reducing the amount of data read and processed.\n- **Type Safety:** Parquet stores data types, which can prevent errors during data processing."
