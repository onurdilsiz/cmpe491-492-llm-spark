            "improvementExplanation": "The code is currently reading a text file, which is likely a CSV file based on the path name. Text files are not optimized for analytical workloads. Reading text files requires parsing each line and inferring the schema, which is inefficient. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance, especially for large datasets. Parquet is generally preferred for its good balance of performance and compatibility.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\ndf1 = spark.read.parquet(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/parquet-file\")\n```\nNote: This assumes the data is already converted to parquet format. If not, the original data needs to be converted to parquet format first.",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet offers several benefits:\n- **Faster Reads:** Parquet is a columnar format, allowing Spark to read only the necessary columns, reducing I/O.\n- **Schema Evolution:** Parquet supports schema evolution, making it easier to handle changes in data structure.\n- **Compression:** Parquet files are typically compressed, reducing storage space and I/O.\n- **Predicate Pushdown:** Spark can push down filters to the Parquet reader, reducing the amount of data read from disk."

            "improvementExplanation": "The code is currently writing the processed data to a CSV file. While compression is used, CSV is still a row-based format, which is not optimal for analytical queries. Writing to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would improve write performance and enable more efficient subsequent reads.

            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet offers several benefits:\n- **Faster Writes:** Parquet is a columnar format, allowing Spark to write data more efficiently.\n- **Schema Preservation:** Parquet stores the schema along with the data, eliminating the need for schema inference during reads.\n- **Compression:** Parquet files are typically compressed, reducing storage space and I/O.\n- **Predicate Pushdown:** Spark can push down filters to the Parquet reader, reducing the amount of data read from disk in subsequent operations."
