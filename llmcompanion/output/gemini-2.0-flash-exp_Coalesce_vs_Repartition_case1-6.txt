      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition(200)` operation is used to increase the number of partitions to 200 before writing the data to disk. This operation triggers a full shuffle of the data across the cluster. If the goal is to reduce the number of partitions for writing, and the current number of partitions is greater than 200, `coalesce(200)` can be used instead. `coalesce()` avoids a full shuffle by combining existing partitions, which is more efficient than `repartition()` when reducing the number of partitions. Since we don't know the initial number of partitions, we can assume that the number of partitions is greater than 200, and we can use coalesce to reduce the number of partitions to 200.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "df_5years.coalesce(200).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").mode(\"overwrite\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000-2005/repartition/200\")",
      "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` reduces the amount of data shuffling across the network, as it attempts to combine existing partitions instead of creating new ones from scratch. This leads to improved resource utilization, reduced network traffic, and potentially faster job runtime. The reduction in shuffling is particularly beneficial when the number of partitions is being reduced, as is the case here."
