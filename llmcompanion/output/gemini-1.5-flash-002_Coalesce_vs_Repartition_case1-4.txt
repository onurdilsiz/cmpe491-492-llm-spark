      "improvementExplanation": "The provided code uses `repartition(50)` before writing the data to CSV.  Since the purpose is to write the data to a file system, the number of partitions only affects the number of files written.  A full shuffle is not necessary.  `coalesce` can reduce the number of partitions without shuffling, provided the target number of partitions is less than or equal to the current number of partitions. If the current number of partitions is less than 50, `coalesce` will not change the number of partitions. If the current number of partitions is greater than 50, `coalesce` will efficiently reduce the number of partitions without a full shuffle.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "df_5years.coalesce(50).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").mode(\"overwrite\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000-2005/coalesce/50\")",
      "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce` avoids a potentially expensive shuffle operation, leading to improved performance, reduced resource consumption (CPU, memory, and network), and faster job completion time. The improvement will be most significant if the initial number of partitions is larger than 50."
