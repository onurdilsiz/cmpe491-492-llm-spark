            "operation": "df_5years.repartition(50) # Line 44",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame to 50. However, since we are only writing the DataFrame to a CSV file, which does not require a specific number of partitions, we can use `coalesce()` instead. `coalesce()` will reduce the number of partitions to the specified number (50 in this case) without shuffling the data, which can improve performance.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df_5years.coalesce(50) # Line 44",
            "benefits": "Replacing `repartition()` with `coalesce()` in this case will avoid unnecessary shuffling of the data, leading to reduced processing time and improved resource utilization."
