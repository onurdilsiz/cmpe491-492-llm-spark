            "improvementExplanation": "Repartitioning an RDD can be computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large datasets. DataFrames offer optimized partitioning strategies that can significantly improve performance.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "df2.repartitionByRange(200, col('Observation_Date'))",
            "benefits": "Using `repartitionByRange` with a column like `Observation_Date` ensures that data is distributed evenly across partitions based on its date, leading to better query performance and reduced shuffling."
