    {
      "operation": "sales_rdd.map(lambda line: line.split(\",\"))",
      "improvementExplanation": "The map operation splits each line of the sales data. This operation can be performed more efficiently using mapPartitions.  Instead of applying the split function to each line individually (resulting in many function calls), mapPartitions processes an entire partition at once. This reduces the overhead of repeatedly calling the function and allows for potential batching optimizations.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "parsed_sales_rdd = sales_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: [line.split(',') for line in iterator])",
      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions reduces function call overhead by processing multiple lines within a partition in a single function call. This can lead to significant performance improvements, especially when dealing with large datasets.  It also allows for potential optimizations within the partition processing, such as using more efficient batch processing techniques."
