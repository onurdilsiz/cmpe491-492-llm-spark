**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of `map()` transformations. Therefore, there are no opportunities to replace them with `mapPartitions()` for improved efficiency.

**Additional Notes:**

* The code snippet includes several user-defined functions (UDFs) for data cleaning and formatting. These UDFs can be used within Spark transformations to manipulate data efficiently.
* While `mapPartitions()` can offer performance benefits in certain scenarios, it's important to carefully evaluate the specific use case and data characteristics before making the switch.
* Consider factors such as data size, partition size, and the nature of the transformation when deciding between `map()` and `mapPartitions()`.
