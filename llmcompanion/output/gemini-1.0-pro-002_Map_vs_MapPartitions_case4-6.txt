**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of the `map()` transformation. Therefore, there are no opportunities to replace it with `mapPartitions()` for improved efficiency.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided code snippet primarily focuses on defining user-defined functions (UDFs) for data cleaning and transformation.
* While `mapPartitions()` can be beneficial for optimizing partition-level operations, it's not applicable in this specific case.
* If the code involved processing large datasets with partition-level operations, replacing `map()` with `mapPartitions()` could potentially improve performance.
