      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with a built-in function offers several benefits:\n\n* **Catalyst Optimizations:** Spark's Catalyst optimizer can analyze and optimize built-in functions, potentially leading to improved query performance.\n* **Performance:** Built-in functions are generally more efficient than UDFs, as they are implemented in Scala and compiled to native code.\n* **Serialization Overhead:** UDFs require serialization and deserialization during execution, which can add overhead. Built-in functions avoid this overhead."
