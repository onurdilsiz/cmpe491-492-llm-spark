      "operation": "Line 24: `delta_mol` UDF used to calculate percentage differences between consecutive elements in an array.",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `delta_mol` UDF can be replaced with a combination of Spark SQL functions and native DataFrame/Dataset operations. This approach avoids the overhead of UDF serialization and enables Catalyst optimizations for better performance.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import array_zip_with, col, lit, when\n\ndf = df.withColumn(\n    'delta_arry',\n    array_zip_with(col('array_col'), col('array_col')[1:],\n                    lambda x, y: when(x != 0.0, (y / x - 1) * 100).otherwise(lit(0.0)))\n)\n```",
      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with built-in functions and native operations offers several benefits:\n- **Catalyst Optimizations:** Spark's Catalyst optimizer can effectively optimize expressions involving built-in functions and native operations, leading to improved query performance.\n- **Performance Improvement:** Avoiding UDFs reduces serialization overhead, as UDFs require transferring Python functions to executors, which can be time-consuming.\n- **Code Readability:** Using built-in functions and native operations often results in more concise and readable code, making it easier to understand and maintain."
