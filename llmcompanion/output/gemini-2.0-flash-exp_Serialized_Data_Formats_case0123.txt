      "operation": "Reading from text file using `spark.sparkContext.textFile(\"path/to/logs.txt\")`",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads log data from a text file. Text files are not optimized for analytical workloads. Reading and parsing each line of a text file is inefficient. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance, especially for large datasets, as it allows for predicate pushdown and efficient data skipping.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nlog_df = spark.read.parquet(\"path/to/logs.parquet\") # Assuming logs are stored in parquet format\n# or\nlog_df = spark.read.orc(\"path/to/logs.orc\") # Assuming logs are stored in orc format\n```",
      "benefits": "Faster reads due to columnar storage, predicate pushdown, and efficient data skipping. Compression reduces storage space and I/O overhead."

      "improvementExplanation": "The code writes error logs to a CSV file. CSV is a row-based format and is not optimized for analytical queries. Writing to CSV is also slower than writing to columnar formats. Switching to Parquet or ORC would improve write performance and enable efficient querying later on.",

      "benefits": "Faster writes due to columnar storage and efficient encoding. Compression reduces storage space. Enables predicate pushdown and efficient data skipping for subsequent reads."
