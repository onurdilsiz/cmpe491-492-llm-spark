      "improvementExplanation": "The `cache()` operation persists the `termDocMatrix` in memory, making subsequent operations faster. However, it also increases memory usage. If memory is a constraint, you can consider using `coalesce()` instead of `cache()` to reduce the number of partitions and potentially free up some memory. This is especially beneficial if the number of partitions is significantly higher than the number of cores available.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "termDocMatrix = termDocMatrix.coalesce(numPartitions)",
      "benefits": "Using `coalesce()` instead of `cache()` can potentially reduce memory usage and improve performance by reducing the number of partitions. However, it's important to note that `coalesce()` does not guarantee that the data will be evenly distributed across partitions, which could lead to performance issues if the data is skewed."
