            "improvementExplanation": "The current CSV format is not optimized for Spark processing. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve read performance due to columnar storage, compression, and efficient data encoding.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Replace pandas.read_csv() with spark.read.parquet()\nimport pyspark.sql.functions as F\n\n# Assuming the CSV file is named 'airport-data.csv' and stored in the same directory as the script\ncsv_path = 'airport-data.csv'\n\ndf = spark.read.parquet(csv_path)\n\n# Convert the DataFrame to pandas format if needed\npd_df = df.toPandas()\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC will provide the following benefits:\n- **Faster reads:** Columnar storage allows for efficient data access by only reading the required columns, reducing I/O operations.\n- **Compression:** Parquet and ORC use efficient compression algorithms, reducing storage space and network transfer times.\n- **Query optimization:** Spark can leverage predicate pushdown to filter data before reading it, further improving query performance."
