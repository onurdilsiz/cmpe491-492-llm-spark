            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition(100)` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame to 100. However, since the DataFrame is already partitioned by `page_id`, which is likely to have a high number of distinct values, using `coalesce(100)` instead would achieve the same effect without incurring a full shuffle. This is because `coalesce()` only reduces the number of partitions, while `repartition()` forces a full shuffle to redistribute data across the new partitions.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df = df.coalesce(100)",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` in this case would reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and potentially lead to a faster job runtime."
