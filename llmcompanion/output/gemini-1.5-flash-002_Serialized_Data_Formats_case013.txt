      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads transaction data from a text file (CSV) using RDDs.  This is inefficient because RDDs are not optimized for structured data processing.  Switching to Parquet or ORC allows for schema enforcement, columnar storage, and efficient compression, leading to faster reads and writes, and better query performance.  The initial data loading should be done directly into a DataFrame using the Spark SQL reader.",

      "improvementExplanation": "The code saves the processed data to a CSV file. CSV is not an efficient format for large datasets.  Parquet or ORC offer better compression, columnar storage, and support for schema evolution, resulting in significantly faster write times and smaller file sizes.  They also enable predicate pushdown for improved query performance.",
