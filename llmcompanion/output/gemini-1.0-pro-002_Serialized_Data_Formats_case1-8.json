            "improvementExplanation": "Delta format is a good choice for storing and managing large datasets, but it may not be the most efficient format for reading data into Spark. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve read performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.",

            "benefits": "Reading data from Parquet or ORC format can provide the following benefits:\n* **Faster reads:** Parquet and ORC are columnar formats, which means that only the necessary columns are read from disk, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed.\n* **Compression:** Parquet and ORC support compression, which can significantly reduce the size of the data on disk, leading to faster reads and lower storage costs.\n* **Query optimization:** Parquet and ORC support predicate pushdown, which allows Spark to filter data at the file level before reading it into memory, further improving query performance."
