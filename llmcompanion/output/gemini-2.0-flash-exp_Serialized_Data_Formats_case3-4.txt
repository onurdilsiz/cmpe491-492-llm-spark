      "improvementExplanation": "The current code reads location data from a CSV file. CSV is a row-based format and is not optimized for analytical queries. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet would significantly improve read performance, especially when only a subset of columns is needed. Parquet also supports compression, reducing storage space and I/O costs.",
