**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of `repartition()`. Therefore, there are no opportunities to replace it with `coalesce()` for improved efficiency. The code primarily focuses on reading a text file, splitting it into words, and performing calculations on those words. It does not involve any shuffling or repartitioning operations.
