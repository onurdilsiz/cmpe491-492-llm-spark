            "operation": "electronics_sales_df.repartition(10)  # Unnecessary shuffling across nodes",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame. However, in this case, the DataFrame is being written to an output file, which does not require a specific number of partitions. Therefore, we can replace `repartition()` with `coalesce()` to reduce the number of partitions and avoid unnecessary shuffling across nodes.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "electronics_sales_df.coalesce(1)",
            "benefits": "Replacing `repartition()` with `coalesce()` will reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and potentially speed up the job runtime."
