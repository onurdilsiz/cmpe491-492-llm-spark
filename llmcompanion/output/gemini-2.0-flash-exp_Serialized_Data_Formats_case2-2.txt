      "operation": "Reading binary files from HDFS using `sc.binaryFiles(inputDir, numExec)`",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads binary files directly from HDFS. While this works, it doesn't leverage the benefits of structured, serialized formats like Parquet or ORC. These formats offer schema enforcement, compression, and predicate pushdown, which can significantly improve read performance, especially for large datasets. Switching to Parquet or ORC would involve converting the input data to one of these formats before processing with Spark.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Assuming the input data is converted to Parquet and stored in inputDir\n# Example: inputDir = '/user/aggour/rpi/spark/tensor-parquet/'\n\n# Read Parquet files\nrows = spark.read.parquet(inputDir)\n\n# Convert to RDD if needed\ntensorRDD = rows.rdd.map(lambda row: (row[0], np.frombuffer(row[1], dtype=np.float64).reshape(row[2]))).persist(pyspark.StorageLevel.MEMORY_ONLY)\n\n# Note: The above assumes the parquet file has columns like (filename, binary_data, shape)\n# You'll need to adjust the lambda function based on your actual schema\n```",
      "benefits": "Faster reads due to columnar storage and compression, schema enforcement, and potential for predicate pushdown during query execution."

    {
      "operation": "Saving numpy arrays to local disk using `np.save(filename, Ci)` and `np.save(filename, A)` and `np.save(filename, B)`",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code saves NumPy arrays to local disk as `.npy` files. This is inefficient for distributed processing because it requires writing to local disk on each executor, which can be slow and create a bottleneck. It also requires moving the files to HDFS after the computation. Instead, saving the data in a distributed, columnar format like Parquet or ORC would be more efficient. This would allow Spark to write directly to HDFS in a distributed manner, and the data would be readily available for further processing.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Assuming A, B, and Ci are numpy arrays\n\n# Convert numpy arrays to Spark DataFrames\ndef to_df(data, name):\n    df = spark.createDataFrame([ (name, data.tobytes(), data.shape) ], ['name', 'data', 'shape'])\n    return df\n\ndf_A = to_df(A, 'A')\ndf_B = to_df(B, 'B')\ndf_Ci = to_df(Ci, 'Ci-' + str(labelId))\n\n# Save DataFrames as Parquet files\nif outputDir != '':\n    df_A.write.mode('overwrite').parquet(outputDir + '/A')\n    df_B.write.mode('overwrite').parquet(outputDir + '/B')\n    df_Ci.write.mode('overwrite').parquet(outputDir + '/Ci-' + str(labelId))\n\n# Note: The above assumes you have a SparkSession named 'spark'\n# You'll need to adjust the schema and column names based on your actual data\n```",
      "benefits": "Faster writes due to distributed writes to HDFS, compression, schema enforcement, and better integration with Spark's distributed processing capabilities."

    {
      "operation": "Moving local files to HDFS using `subprocess.call(['hadoop fs -moveFromLocal ' + './*.npy ' + outputDir], shell=True)`",
      "improvementExplanation": "This operation moves the locally saved `.npy` files to HDFS using a shell command. This is inefficient because it involves an external process and requires moving data from local disk to HDFS after the computation. This can be avoided by directly writing to HDFS using Spark's built-in functionalities for Parquet or ORC formats.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "This operation is replaced by the optimized equivalent in the previous entry. By writing directly to HDFS using Spark's DataFrame API, we eliminate the need for this shell command.",
      "benefits": "Eliminates the need for an external process, faster writes due to distributed writes to HDFS, and better integration with Spark's distributed processing capabilities."
