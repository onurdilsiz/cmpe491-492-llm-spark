      "improvementExplanation": "The initial loading of data using `spark.sparkContext.textFile` creates an RDD. This can be replaced with `spark.read.text` to load the data as a DataFrame, which allows for schema inference and query optimization.",

      "benefits": "Using DataFrames allows for schema inference, query optimization through Catalyst, and easier integration with structured data formats. It also reduces the need for manual parsing and type conversions."

      "operation": "parsed_logs_rdd = log_rdd.map(lambda line: line.split(\",\"))",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `map` operation on the RDD is used to parse the log lines. This can be done directly when loading the data as a DataFrame using the `split` function and creating new columns.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "log_df = spark.read.text(\"path/to/logs.txt\")\nlog_df = log_df.withColumn(\"timestamp\", split(col(\"value\"), \",\").getItem(0))\nlog_df = log_df.withColumn(\"level\", split(col(\"value\"), \",\").getItem(1))\nlog_df = log_df.withColumn(\"message\", split(col(\"value\"), \",\").getItem(2)).drop(\"value\")",

      "dataframeEquivalent": "error_logs_df = log_df.filter(col(\"level\") == \"ERROR\")",

      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition` operation is used to increase the number of partitions to 10. If the goal is to reduce the number of partitions, `coalesce` should be used instead to avoid a full shuffle.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "coalesced_df = error_logs_df.coalesce(10)",

      "improvementExplanation": "The `map` operation is used to extract the timestamp from each log. This can be done more efficiently using `mapPartitions` to process data in batches at the partition level.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "timestamps_rdd = error_logs_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: [log[0] for log in partition])",
      "benefits": "Using `mapPartitions` reduces the function call overhead by processing data in batches, which can improve performance, especially for I/O-heavy operations. In this case, it's not a significant improvement since the operation is simple, but it's a good practice for more complex transformations."
