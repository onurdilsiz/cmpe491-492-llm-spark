      "improvementExplanation": "This map() operation is used to split each line of the text file into an array of values. This is an element-wise operation, meaning it processes each line individually. However, splitting strings is a relatively lightweight operation that can be efficiently performed on a batch of lines at once. By using mapPartitions() instead, we can process multiple lines together, reducing the number of function calls and improving performance.",
