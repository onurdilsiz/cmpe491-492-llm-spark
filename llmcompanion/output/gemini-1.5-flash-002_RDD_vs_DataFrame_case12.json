            "rddOperation": "sales_rdd.map(lambda row: (row[\"sale_id\"], row[\"category\"], row[\"amount\"] * 0.9))  # Inefficient element-wise processing (line 26)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The RDD `map` operation processes each element individually, which is less efficient than DataFrame's vectorized operations. DataFrames can perform the same calculation on all rows simultaneously, leveraging Spark's optimized execution engine.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "discounted_sales_df = sales_df.withColumn(\"discounted_amount\", sales_df[\"amount\"] * 0.9)\nprint(\"Sample discounted sales:\", discounted_sales_df.select(\"sale_id\", \"category\", \"discounted_amount\").show(5))",
            "benefits": "Switching to DataFrame's `withColumn` provides significant performance gains due to its vectorized processing. It reduces the overhead of individual element processing and leverages Spark's optimized execution plan, leading to faster execution and better resource utilization.  It also avoids the unnecessary conversion to and from RDDs."
