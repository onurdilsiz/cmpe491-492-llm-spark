      "operation": "map() operation on lemmatized data (line 17)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The map() operation on the lemmatized data performs a transformation on each individual element. This can be inefficient for partition-level operations like I/O or batch processing. Replacing it with mapPartitions() allows processing data in batches within each partition, reducing function call overhead and potentially improving I/O efficiency.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\nlemmatized = plainText.mapPartitions(lambda itr: map(lambda tc: (tc[0], plainTextToLemmas(tc[1], stopWords, pipeline)), itr))\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() offers several benefits:\n- **Reduced function call overhead:** By processing data in batches within partitions, mapPartitions() reduces the number of function calls compared to map(), leading to improved performance.\n- **Optimized I/O:** For I/O-bound operations, mapPartitions() can potentially improve efficiency by reading or writing data in larger chunks within each partition.\n- **Improved resource utilization:** By reducing function call overhead and potentially optimizing I/O, mapPartitions() can lead to better resource utilization."
