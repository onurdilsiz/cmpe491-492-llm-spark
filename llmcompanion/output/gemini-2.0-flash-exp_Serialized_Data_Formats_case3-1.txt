      "operation": "Reading CSV data from filepaths specified in config: `spark.read.option(\"delimiter\", \"|\").csv(conf[\"filepaths\"], inferSchema=True, header=True)`",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code currently reads data from CSV files. CSV is a row-based format, which is not optimized for analytical queries. Reading CSV files involves parsing text, which is computationally expensive. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance, especially for large datasets. Parquet and ORC are binary formats that are optimized for analytical workloads, offering better compression and predicate pushdown capabilities.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\ndf = spark.read.parquet(conf[\"filepaths\"])\n# Assuming the filepaths in config now point to parquet files\n```\nOR\n```python\ndf = spark.read.orc(conf[\"filepaths\"])\n# Assuming the filepaths in config now point to orc files\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC offers several benefits:\n- **Faster Reads:** Columnar formats allow Spark to read only the necessary columns, reducing I/O and improving read speeds.\n- **Compression:** Parquet and ORC provide efficient compression, reducing storage space and I/O.\n- **Predicate Pushdown:** These formats support predicate pushdown, allowing Spark to filter data at the storage layer, further reducing the amount of data read.\n- **Schema Evolution:** Parquet and ORC support schema evolution, making it easier to handle changes in data structure over time."

      "operation": "Saving the trained model: `best_pipeline.save(conf[\"model_output_path\"])`",
      "improvementExplanation": "While this operation saves the trained model, it's not directly related to data input/output in the context of the dataframe. However, if the model output path is used to store intermediate data, it could benefit from using a more efficient format. If the model output path is used to store the model itself, the current format is fine. If the model output path is used to store intermediate data, then using Parquet or ORC would be beneficial.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# If the model output path is used to store intermediate data\ndf_train.write.parquet(conf[\"model_output_path\"])\n# Assuming the model_output_path in config now points to a directory for parquet files\n```\nOR\n```python\n# If the model output path is used to store intermediate data\ndf_train.write.orc(conf[\"model_output_path\"])\n# Assuming the model_output_path in config now points to a directory for orc files\n```",
      "benefits": "If the model output path is used to store intermediate data, switching to Parquet or ORC offers several benefits:\n- **Faster Writes:** Columnar formats allow Spark to write data more efficiently.\n- **Compression:** Parquet and ORC provide efficient compression, reducing storage space and I/O.\n- **Faster Reads:** If the intermediate data is read later, columnar formats allow Spark to read only the necessary columns, reducing I/O and improving read speeds.\n- **Predicate Pushdown:** If the intermediate data is read later, these formats support predicate pushdown, allowing Spark to filter data at the storage layer, further reducing the amount of data read."
