            "operation": "Reading local stream from file: file:path/to/file",
            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a local file in a non-optimized format. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve read performance, especially for large datasets. These formats are optimized for columnar storage and compression, leading to faster data access and reduced storage requirements.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read data from Parquet file\nsqldf = spark.read.parquet(\"path/to/file.parquet\")\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC will provide the following benefits:\n* **Faster reads:** Columnar storage and compression allow for faster data access.\n* **Reduced storage requirements:** Compression can significantly reduce the storage space needed for the data.\n* **Improved query optimization:** Parquet and ORC support predicate pushdown, which allows Spark to filter data at the file level, further improving query performance."

            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation writes data to a table in Parquet format, which is already an optimized format. However, it's important to ensure that the compression codec is set to a suitable option like gzip or snappy for further optimization.",

            "benefits": "Using gzip compression with Parquet can further reduce storage requirements and improve read performance."
