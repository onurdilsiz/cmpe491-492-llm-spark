            "operation": "Reading local stream from file: file:path/to/file",
            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a local file in a stream format. This can be inefficient for large datasets, as it requires reading the entire file into memory. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve performance by allowing Spark to read only the necessary data.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read data from Parquet file\nsqlc.read.parquet(\"path/to/file.parquet\")\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC offers several benefits:\n* **Faster reads/writes:** Serialized formats like Parquet and ORC are optimized for efficient data storage and retrieval, resulting in faster read and write operations.\n* **Compression:** These formats support compression, which can significantly reduce the size of the data on disk, saving storage space and improving transfer speeds.\n* **Query optimization:** Parquet and ORC allow for predicate pushdown, where filters are applied directly on the compressed data, further enhancing query performance."

            "operation": "Reading from S3: s3://bucketname/path/to/file",
            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from an S3 bucket using a temporary file. This involves downloading the entire file to local storage before processing, which can be time-consuming and inefficient. Using a serialized format like Parquet or ORC directly on S3 can eliminate the need for local downloads and improve performance.",

            "benefits": "Similar to the previous case, switching to Parquet or ORC on S3 offers the same benefits:\n* **Faster reads/writes:** Efficient data storage and retrieval.\n* **Compression:** Reduced data size and improved transfer speeds.\n* **Query optimization:** Predicate pushdown for faster queries."
