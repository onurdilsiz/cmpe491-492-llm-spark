    {
      "operation": "pandas.read_csv(\"airport-data.csv\")",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads a CSV file using pandas. While CSV is human-readable, it's not optimized for large datasets or Spark processing. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance, especially when dealing with large datasets, as Spark can leverage predicate pushdown and only read the necessary columns. Additionally, Parquet and ORC offer better compression, reducing storage space and I/O overhead.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Assuming you have a Spark DataFrame named 'df_spark' that corresponds to the data in 'airport-data.csv'\n# If not, you would first read the CSV into a Spark DataFrame:\n# df_spark = spark.read.csv(\"airport-data.csv\", header=True, inferSchema=True)\n\n# Save the DataFrame as Parquet\ndf_spark.write.parquet(\"airport-data.parquet\", mode=\"overwrite\")\n\n# Load the Parquet file into a Spark DataFrame\ndf_spark = spark.read.parquet(\"airport-data.parquet\")\n\n# Convert to pandas for sidebar default values\ndf = df_spark.toPandas()\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet offers faster read times due to columnar storage, better compression, and predicate pushdown capabilities, which allow Spark to read only the necessary data. This leads to reduced I/O and faster overall processing."

      "operation": "PipelineModel.load('airport-index/')",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code loads a PipelineModel from a directory. While the specific format is not explicitly stated, it's likely a Spark-specific format. However, it's important to ensure that the model is saved in a format that is optimized for loading and that the directory contains all the necessary files. If the model is saved in a custom format, it might not be as efficient as using Spark's built-in model saving and loading mechanisms. If the model is saved as a single file, it can be loaded more efficiently.",
