            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions from the default to 10. Since the goal is to reduce the number of partitions for writing, and not to increase them, `coalesce()` can be used instead. `coalesce()` avoids a full shuffle when reducing partitions, making it more efficient than `repartition()` in this scenario. `repartition()` always performs a full shuffle, even when reducing the number of partitions, which is unnecessary and costly.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "coalesced_df = usd_transactions_df.coalesce(10)",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` reduces shuffling, as it avoids a full shuffle when reducing the number of partitions. This leads to improved resource usage, as less data needs to be moved across the network, and faster job runtime, as the shuffle operation is a costly operation in Spark. In this specific case, since the number of partitions is being reduced, `coalesce()` is the correct choice."
