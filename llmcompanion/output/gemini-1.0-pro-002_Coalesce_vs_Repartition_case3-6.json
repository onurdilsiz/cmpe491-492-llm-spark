            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition(4)` operation on line 10 is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame to 4. However, since the subsequent operation is `count()`, which only requires a single partition, using `coalesce(4)` instead would achieve the same result without the need for a full shuffle. This would reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred across the network, leading to improved resource usage and faster job runtime.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df.coalesce(4).count()",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce(4)` would:\n- Reduce shuffling by avoiding the need to redistribute data across partitions.\n- Improve resource usage by minimizing data transfer across the network.\n- Potentially lead to faster job runtime due to reduced shuffling overhead."
