    {
      "operation": "Line 12: rdd2=rdd.flatMap(lambda x: x.split(\" \"))",
      "improvementExplanation": "The lambda function in flatMap can be replaced with the built-in split function within a DataFrame operation after converting the RDD to a DataFrame.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "df = spark.read.text(\"/apps/sparkbyexamples/src/pyspark-examples/data.txt\")\ndf = df.select(F.explode(F.split(df.value, \" \")).alias(\"word\"))",
      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with a built-in function allows Spark's Catalyst optimizer to perform more efficient query planning and execution, leading to improved performance and reduced resource consumption."

      "operation": "Line 15: rdd3=rdd2.map(lambda x: (x,1))",
      "improvementExplanation": "The lambda function in map can be replaced with a struct creation within a DataFrame operation.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "df = df.withColumn(\"count\", F.lit(1))",
      "benefits": "Using built-in functions enables Catalyst optimizations, resulting in faster execution and reduced overhead."

    {
      "operation": "Line 18: rdd4=rdd3.reduceByKey(lambda a,b: a+b)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The lambda function in reduceByKey can be replaced with the built-in sum function using groupBy and agg.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "df = df.groupBy(\"word\").agg(F.sum(\"count\").alias(\"sum\"))",
      "benefits": "Leveraging built-in aggregation functions improves performance and allows for better optimization by the Spark engine."

    {
      "operation": "Line 21: rdd5 = rdd4.map(lambda x: (x[1],x[0])).sortByKey()",
      "improvementExplanation": "The lambda function in map can be replaced with column swapping and sorting using built-in DataFrame functions.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "df = df.select(F.col(\"sum\"), F.col(\"word\")).orderBy(\"sum\")",
      "benefits": "Using built-in functions avoids the overhead of UDF serialization and deserialization, leading to performance gains."

    {
      "operation": "Line 24: rdd6 = rdd5.filter(lambda x : 'a' in x[1])",
      "improvementExplanation": "The lambda function in filter can be replaced with a built-in filter condition on the DataFrame.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "df = df.filter(F.col(\"word\").contains(\"a\"))",
      "benefits": "Built-in filter operations are optimized by Spark's Catalyst optimizer, resulting in better performance."
    },
    {
      "operation": "All lambda functions within the RDD operations",
      "improvementExplanation": "The use of RDDs with lambda functions is less efficient than using DataFrames and Spark SQL functions. DataFrames provide a more optimized execution plan and allow for better integration with Spark's Catalyst optimizer.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "The entire RDD-based code should be rewritten using DataFrames and Spark SQL functions as shown in the previous examples.  This involves reading the data into a DataFrame, performing transformations using built-in functions, and then executing the query.",
      "benefits": "Using DataFrames and Spark SQL functions enables Catalyst optimizations, improves performance, and reduces serialization overhead significantly compared to RDDs with UDFs."
