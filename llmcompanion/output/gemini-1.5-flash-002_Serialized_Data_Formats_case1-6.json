            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a text file, which is inefficient for large datasets.  Switching to Parquet or ORC would significantly improve performance.  These formats are columnar, support compression, and enable predicate pushdown, leading to faster query execution and reduced storage costs.  The text format requires Spark to parse each line individually, while Parquet and ORC allow for reading only the necessary columns and rows.",

            "benefits": "Faster read speeds, better compression, reduced storage space, and improved query performance due to predicate pushdown."

            "improvementExplanation": "Writing to CSV is slow, especially with large datasets.  Parquet or ORC offer significant performance improvements during write operations due to their columnar storage and efficient encoding.  LZ4 compression is used, but Parquet and ORC offer better compression ratios and faster decompression.",
