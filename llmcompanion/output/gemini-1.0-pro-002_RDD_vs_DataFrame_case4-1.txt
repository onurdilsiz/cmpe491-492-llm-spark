      "rddOperation": "map",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `map` operation is used to transform each element of an RDD. However, DataFrames/Datasets offer a more efficient way to perform transformations using SQL-like expressions, which can be optimized by Spark's Catalyst optimizer.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\n# Replace the RDD map operation with a DataFrame transformation\nrequest_df = request_df.withColumn(\"execute\", udf_executeRestApi(col(\"verb\"), col(\"url\"), col(\"headers\"), col(\"body\")))\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to DataFrame/Dataset for the `map` operation can lead to:\n* **Query optimizations:** Spark's Catalyst optimizer can optimize DataFrame/Dataset expressions, resulting in more efficient execution plans.\n* **Reduced shuffling:** DataFrames/Datasets avoid unnecessary shuffling of data, which can significantly improve performance for large datasets.\n* **Better resource usage:** DataFrames/Datasets efficiently utilize cluster resources, reducing memory consumption and improving overall performance."
