      "improvementExplanation": "The UDF `extract_title_udf` can be replaced with Spark's built-in `regexp_extract` function to extract the title from the HTML content. This approach avoids the overhead of defining and registering a UDF, potentially improving performance and enabling Catalyst optimizations.",

      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with `regexp_extract` offers several benefits:\n- **Performance improvement:** Built-in functions are generally optimized for performance compared to UDFs.\n- **Catalyst optimization:** Spark's Catalyst optimizer can effectively optimize queries that use built-in functions, potentially leading to further performance gains.\n- **Reduced serialization overhead:** UDFs require serialization and deserialization during execution, which can add overhead. Using built-in functions avoids this overhead."
