    {
      "rddOperation": "plainText.mapPartitions(lemmaMapper)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `mapPartitions` operation on the RDD `plainText` can be replaced with a DataFrame transformation. While `mapPartitions` can be useful for complex operations, DataFrames offer better optimization opportunities through Catalyst and Tungsten. The lemma mapping logic can be encapsulated in a UDF (User Defined Function) and applied to a DataFrame column.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import udf, struct\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import ArrayType, StringType\n\ndef lemmaMapper_udf(text):\n    pipeline = CoreNLP(configdict={'annotators': \"tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma\"},\n                           corenlp_jars=[\"./stanford-corenlp-full-2015-04-20/*\"])\n    return plainTextToLemmas(text, stopWords, pipeline)\n\nlemma_udf = udf(lemmaMapper_udf, ArrayType(StringType()))\n\n# Assuming plainText is an RDD of (id, text) pairs\nplainText_df = sqlContext.createDataFrame(plainText, [\"id\", \"text\"])\nlemmatized_df = plainText_df.withColumn(\"lemmas\", lemma_udf(\"text\"))\n```",
      "benefits": "Using a DataFrame allows Spark to optimize the execution plan, potentially reducing shuffling and improving performance. The UDF approach is more declarative and easier to maintain. Catalyst optimizer can apply various optimizations like predicate pushdown and column pruning. DataFrames also provide better memory management through Tungsten."

    {
      "rddOperation": "lemmatized.filter(lambda l: len(l[1]) > 1)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `filter` operation on the RDD `lemmatized` can be directly translated to a DataFrame filter operation. DataFrames are optimized for such operations, and the filter condition can be expressed using DataFrame API.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import size\n\n# Assuming lemmatized_df has columns 'id' and 'lemmas'\nfiltered_df = lemmatized_df.filter(size(\"lemmas\") > 1)\n```",
      "benefits": "DataFrame filters are optimized by Spark's Catalyst optimizer, which can push down the filter operation closer to the data source, reducing the amount of data processed. This leads to better performance and resource utilization compared to RDD filters."
    },

      "rddOperation": "docWeights = u.rows.map(lambda r: r[i]).zipWithUniqueId()",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `map` and `zipWithUniqueId` operations on the `u.rows` RDD can be replaced with DataFrame operations. We can convert the `u.rows` RDD to a DataFrame and then use DataFrame functions to achieve the same result. The `zipWithUniqueId` can be replaced with `monotonically_increasing_id`.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import monotonically_increasing_id, col\n\n# Assuming u.rows is an RDD of Vector objects\nu_rows_df = sqlContext.createDataFrame(u.rows.map(lambda r: (r,)), [\"vector\"])\n\ndef extract_ith_element(vector, i):\n    return vector[i]\n\nextract_ith_element_udf = udf(extract_ith_element, DoubleType())\n\ndocWeights_df = u_rows_df.withColumn(\"weight\", extract_ith_element_udf(\"vector\", lit(i))).withColumn(\"id\", monotonically_increasing_id())\n\n# To get the top docs, we can use the orderBy and limit functions\ntop_docs_df = docWeights_df.orderBy(col(\"weight\").desc()).limit(numDocs)\n\n# To get the final result, we can map the DataFrame back to the desired format\ntopDocs = top_docs_df.rdd.map(lambda row: (docIds[row.id], row.weight)).collect()\n```",
      "benefits": "Using DataFrames allows Spark to optimize the execution plan, potentially reducing shuffling and improving performance. The DataFrame API is more declarative and easier to maintain. The use of `monotonically_increasing_id` is more efficient than `zipWithUniqueId` in many cases. The `orderBy` and `limit` operations are also optimized by the Catalyst optimizer."

      "rddOperation": "docWeights.top(numDocs)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `top` action on the RDD `docWeights` can be replaced with DataFrame operations. We can convert the `docWeights` RDD to a DataFrame and then use DataFrame functions to achieve the same result. The `top` action can be replaced with `orderBy` and `limit`.",
