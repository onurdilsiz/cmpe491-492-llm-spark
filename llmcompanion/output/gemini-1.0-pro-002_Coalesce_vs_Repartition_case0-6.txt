**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of `repartition()`. Therefore, there are no opportunities to replace it with `coalesce()` for improved efficiency. The code primarily focuses on creating an RDD from a list of strings, splitting the strings into words using `flatMap()`, and then printing the individual words. 

If you encounter scenarios where `repartition()` is used in your Spark code, feel free to provide the code snippet, and I'll be happy to analyze it and suggest potential replacements with `coalesce()` along with the associated benefits.
