      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads JSON data from a file, which can be inefficient for large datasets. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve read performance due to their optimized data structures and compression capabilities.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nimport pyspark.sql.functions as F\n\ndf = spark.read.parquet('links.parquet')\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC will provide faster read performance, reduced storage space due to compression, and improved query optimization through predicate pushdown."

      "operation": "Writing DataFrame to Parquet file (line 101)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation writes the DataFrame to a Parquet file, which is already an optimized format. However, it's important to ensure that the DataFrame is partitioned and compressed for optimal performance.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Assuming 'df_transformed' is the DataFrame to write\ndf_transformed.write.mode('overwrite').parquet('s3a://ai-crap/data/nasdaq.parquet', partitionBy=['date'], compression='snappy')\n```",
      "benefits": "Partitioning the DataFrame by date will allow for faster queries that filter based on date, and using Snappy compression will further reduce storage space."
