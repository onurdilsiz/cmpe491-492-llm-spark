      "improvementExplanation": "Reading JSON files using `open` and `json.loads` can be inefficient, especially for large datasets. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve read performance due to their optimized data structures and compression capabilities.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nimport pyspark.sql.functions as F\n\ndf = spark.read.parquet(\"links.parquet\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC will provide the following benefits:\n* **Faster reads:** Parquet and ORC use columnar storage, which allows for faster data access compared to row-based formats like JSON.\n* **Compression:** Parquet and ORC support efficient compression algorithms, reducing storage space and network transfer times.\n* **Query optimization:** Parquet and ORC enable predicate pushdown, where filters are applied directly on the compressed data, further improving query performance."
