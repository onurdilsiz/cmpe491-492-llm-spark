            "improvementExplanation": "The `makePairs` UDF transforms a tuple of (user, ratings) into a tuple of ((movie1, movie2), (rating1, rating2)). This can be achieved using native Spark transformations like `map` with a lambda function, avoiding the overhead of a UDF.",

            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with a lambda function allows Spark to optimize the transformation using Catalyst, potentially improving performance and reducing serialization overhead."

            "improvementExplanation": "The `filterDuplicates` UDF filters out duplicate movie pairs based on movie IDs. This can be achieved using a `filter` transformation with a lambda function, which is more efficient than a UDF.",

            "benefits": "Using a lambda function with `filter` allows Spark to optimize the filtering process, leading to better performance and reduced serialization costs compared to a UDF."

            "operation": "def computeCosineSimilarity(ratingPairs): ... (line 21-34)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `computeCosineSimilarity` UDF calculates the cosine similarity between two sets of ratings. While this is a more complex operation, it can be implemented using Spark's built-in functions and aggregations. However, for this specific case, the complexity of the calculation and the need for multiple iterations within the function make it less straightforward to replace with a single Spark operation. While a UDF is used here, it's not easily replaceable with a single built-in function. The core logic of the UDF involves iterating through the rating pairs, which is not directly supported by Spark's built-in functions. The UDF is used after a `groupByKey` operation, which is not ideal for performance. A better approach would be to use a more efficient aggregation method if possible, but that would require a significant restructuring of the code.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "No direct replacement with a single built-in function is feasible without significantly restructuring the code. The UDF is used after a `groupByKey` operation, which is not ideal for performance. A better approach would be to use a more efficient aggregation method if possible, but that would require a significant restructuring of the code.",
            "benefits": "While a direct replacement is not feasible, the general principle of avoiding UDFs where possible still applies. In this case, the UDF is used after a `groupByKey` operation, which is not ideal for performance. A better approach would be to use a more efficient aggregation method if possible, but that would require a significant restructuring of the code. If a replacement were possible, it would enable Catalyst optimizations, improve performance, and reduce serialization overhead."
