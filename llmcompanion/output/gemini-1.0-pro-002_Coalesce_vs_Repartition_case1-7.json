            "improvementExplanation": "The current `repartition()` operation is used to distribute the DataFrame based on the `_salted_key` column. However, since the goal is to create files of a specific size, using `coalesce()` instead of `repartition()` would be more efficient. `coalesce()` reduces the number of partitions without shuffling the data, which is ideal in this scenario where we only need to adjust the partition count without changing the data distribution.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df = df.coalesce(number_of_files)\n            .drop('_salted_key')",
            "benefits": "Replacing `repartition()` with `coalesce()` will avoid unnecessary shuffling, leading to improved resource utilization and faster job execution. This is because `coalesce()` simply merges partitions without moving data around, while `repartition()` involves a full shuffle operation."
