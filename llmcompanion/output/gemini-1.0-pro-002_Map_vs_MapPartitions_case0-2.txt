      "operation": "Map operation on spam_features: line 17",
      "improvementExplanation": "The map operation on `spam_features` transforms each word into a feature vector using the `HashingTF` instance. This operation involves iterating over each word in the RDD, which can be computationally expensive. By using `mapPartitions()`, we can process multiple words at once within each partition, reducing the number of function calls and improving performance.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\nspam_features = spam_words.mapPartitions(lambda partition: tf.transform(partition))\n```",
      "benefits": "Using `mapPartitions()` in this case offers several benefits:\n- **Reduced function call overhead:** By processing multiple words at once, we reduce the number of calls to the `HashingTF` instance, leading to improved performance.\n- **Optimized I/O:** Reading and processing data in larger chunks can improve I/O efficiency, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n- **Improved resource utilization:** By processing data in parallel within partitions, we can utilize multiple cores and improve resource utilization."

      "operation": "Map operation on non_spam_features: line 18",
      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the previous case, the map operation on `non_spam_features` also involves iterating over each word and transforming it into a feature vector. Using `mapPartitions()` can significantly improve the performance of this operation by processing multiple words at once within each partition.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\nnon_spam_features = non_spam_words.mapPartitions(lambda partition: tf.transform(partition))\n```",
      "benefits": "The benefits of using `mapPartitions()` in this case are the same as those mentioned for the previous operation: reduced function call overhead, optimized I/O, and improved resource utilization."
