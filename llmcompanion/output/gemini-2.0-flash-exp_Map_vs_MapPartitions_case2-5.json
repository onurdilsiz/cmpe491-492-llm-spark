            "improvementExplanation": "The `map` operation here is used to transform each element of the `termSorted` list, which is a list of tuples. This transformation involves accessing `termIds` using the index from the tuple. Since this operation is applied to each element of a list within a loop, it can be more efficient to perform this transformation at the partition level using `mapPartitions`. This avoids the overhead of calling the lambda function for each element individually.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "def termMapper(itr):\n    return [ (termIds[x[0]], x[1]) for x in itr ]\n\ntopTerms.append(list(termMapper(termSorted[0:numTerms])))",
            "benefits": "By using `mapPartitions`, we reduce the function call overhead. Instead of calling the lambda function for each element, we call the `termMapper` function once per partition (in this case, the list `termSorted[0:numTerms]`). This can lead to performance improvements, especially when the list is large. Although the list is not an RDD, the concept of applying a function to a batch of elements is similar to how `mapPartitions` works on RDDs."

            "operation": "map(lambda doc: (docIds[doc[1]], doc[0]), docWeights.top(numDocs))",
            "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the previous case, this `map` operation transforms each element of the list returned by `docWeights.top(numDocs)`. This transformation involves accessing `docIds` using the index from the tuple. This can be optimized by using `mapPartitions` to perform the transformation on the entire list at once, reducing the overhead of individual function calls.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "def docMapper(itr):\n    return [ (docIds[doc[1]], doc[0]) for doc in itr ]\n\ntopDocs.append(list(docMapper(docWeights.top(numDocs))))",
            "benefits": "Switching to `mapPartitions` reduces the function call overhead.
