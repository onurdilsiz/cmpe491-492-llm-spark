      "improvementExplanation": "The UDF `synthetic_page_skeleton_and_paragraphs_udf` can be replaced with a combination of built-in Spark SQL functions and native DataFrame/Dataset operations. This would improve performance by enabling Catalyst optimizations and reducing serialization overhead.",

      "benefits": "Replacing UDFs with built-in functions and native DataFrame/Dataset operations offers several benefits:\n\n* **Catalyst Optimizations:** Catalyst is Spark's query optimizer that can significantly improve query performance by generating efficient execution plans. UDFs bypass Catalyst, preventing it from optimizing queries that involve them.\n* **Performance Improvement:** Built-in functions and native operations are often optimized for performance, while UDFs introduce additional overhead due to serialization and deserialization.\n* **Reduced Serialization Overhead:** UDFs require serialization and deserialization when passed between executors, which can impact performance. Using built-in functions and native operations avoids this overhead."
