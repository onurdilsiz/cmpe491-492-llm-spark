      "improvementExplanation": "Reading data from a CSV file can be slow and inefficient, especially for large datasets. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve read performance due to their optimized columnar storage and compression capabilities.",

      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC will provide the following benefits:\n* **Faster reads:** Columnar storage allows for efficient data access by only reading the required columns, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed.\n* **Compression:** Parquet and ORC use efficient compression algorithms that can significantly reduce the size of the data on disk, leading to faster reads and lower storage costs.\n* **Query optimization:** Parquet and ORC support predicate pushdown, which allows Spark to filter data at the file level before reading it into memory, further improving query performance."
