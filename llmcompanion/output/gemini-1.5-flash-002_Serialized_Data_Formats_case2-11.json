            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a JSON file, which is a text-based format.  JSON files are not optimized for storage or query performance in a distributed environment like Spark.  Switching to a columnar storage format like Parquet or ORC significantly improves performance by enabling efficient data compression, predicate pushdown, and vectorized processing.",
