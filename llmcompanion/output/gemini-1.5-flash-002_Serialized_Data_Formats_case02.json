            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads employee data from a text file (\"path/to/employees.txt\") using the textFile method, which is inefficient for large datasets.  Switching to a columnar storage format like Parquet or ORC significantly improves read performance, especially for analytical queries.  These formats offer better compression and enable predicate pushdown, allowing Spark to filter data before reading it entirely into memory.",

            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC offers significant performance improvements:\n* **Faster Reads:** Columnar storage allows Spark to read only the necessary columns, reducing I/O operations.\n* **Compression:** Parquet and ORC provide efficient compression, reducing storage space and improving read speeds.\n* **Predicate Pushdown:**  Spark can filter data at the storage level, further reducing the amount of data processed.\n* **Improved Query Performance:** Overall query performance is significantly enhanced due to the combined benefits of faster reads, compression, and predicate pushdown."
