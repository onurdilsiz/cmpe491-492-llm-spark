            "operation": "repartitioned_df = error_logs_df.repartition(10)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The code uses `repartition(10)` to increase the number of partitions to 10.  This forces a full shuffle of the data, regardless of the initial number of partitions. If the initial number of partitions is already greater than or equal to 10, this operation is unnecessary and inefficient. If the initial number of partitions is less than 10, using `coalesce` would be more efficient as it avoids a full shuffle and only redistributes the data if necessary.  `coalesce` attempts to reduce the number of partitions without shuffling, only performing a shuffle if the target number of partitions is greater than the current number.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "repartitioned_df = error_logs_df.coalesce(10)",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce(10)` offers significant performance gains by avoiding unnecessary data shuffling. This leads to reduced resource consumption (CPU, memory, network), faster job completion times, and improved overall efficiency.  If the initial partition count is already 10 or greater, `coalesce` will not perform any operation, resulting in the fastest execution."
