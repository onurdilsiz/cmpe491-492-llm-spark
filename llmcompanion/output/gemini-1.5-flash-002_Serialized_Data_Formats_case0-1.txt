      "operation": "Reading movie names from \"ml-100k/u.ITEM\" file using a text-based format in `loadMovieNames` function (lines 6-11).",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current implementation reads movie names from a text file, likely in a simple format like CSV or delimited text.  This is inefficient for large datasets.  Switching to Parquet or ORC would significantly improve performance. Parquet and ORC are columnar storage formats that offer better compression and enable predicate pushdown, allowing Spark to read only the necessary columns and rows, leading to faster query execution.  They also support schema enforcement, improving data integrity.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nimport sys\nfrom pyspark import SparkConf, SparkContext\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nfrom math import sqrt\n\n# ... other functions ...\n\nconf = SparkConf().setMaster(\"local[*]\").setAppName(\"MovieSimilarities\")\nsc = SparkContext(conf = conf)\nspark = SparkSession(sc)\n\nmovieNamesDF = spark.read.parquet(\"movie_names.parquet\")\nnameDict = {row.movieID: row.movieName for row in movieNamesDF.collect()}\n\n# ... rest of the code ...\n```\nNote: This requires saving the movie names as a Parquet file beforehand using:\n```python\nmovieNamesDF.write.parquet(\"movie_names.parquet\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Faster reads due to columnar storage and compression.  Improved query performance due to predicate pushdown. Reduced storage space due to compression. Schema enforcement for data integrity."

      "operation": "Reading user ratings data from \"file:///SparkCourse/ml-100k/u.data\" using a text-based format (line 26).",
      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to movie names, the user ratings data is read from a text file, likely CSV.  This is inefficient for large datasets.  Switching to Parquet or ORC would provide significant performance gains.  Parquet and ORC's columnar storage and compression capabilities would lead to faster reads and writes, and predicate pushdown would allow Spark to filter data efficiently.",
