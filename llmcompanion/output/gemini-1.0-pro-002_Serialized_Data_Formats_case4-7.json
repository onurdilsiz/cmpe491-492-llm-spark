            "operation": "Read from Kinesis Stream (line 14)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a Kinesis Stream, which is not an optimized format for large-scale data processing. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed and enabling efficient compression.",

            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC would provide the following benefits:\n* **Faster reads/writes:** Serialized formats like Parquet and ORC are optimized for efficient data storage and retrieval, resulting in faster read and write operations.\n* **Compression:** These formats offer significant compression capabilities, reducing storage costs and network transfer times.\n* **Query optimization:** Parquet and ORC support predicate pushdown, which allows Spark to filter data at the file level, further improving query performance."
