      "operation": "Reading from a text file using `sc.textFile(sys.argv[1], 1)`",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a text file, which is then parsed as CSV. Text files are not optimized for analytical workloads. Reading and parsing CSV data is inefficient due to the lack of schema and the need to parse each line. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance, especially for large datasets, as it allows for schema enforcement, predicate pushdown, and efficient data skipping.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"OptimizedRead\").getOrCreate()\n\ndf = spark.read.option(\"header\", \"true\").csv(sys.argv[1])\n\n# Assuming the column you are interested in is named 'column_17' (index 16)\nresults = df.rdd.map(lambda row: check_prem_typ_desc(row['column_17']))\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC provides faster reads due to columnar storage, schema enforcement, predicate pushdown, and efficient data skipping. These formats also offer better compression, reducing storage space and I/O overhead."

      "operation": "Writing to a text file using `results.saveAsTextFile('check_prem_typ_desc.out')`",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code writes the results to a text file. Writing to text files is inefficient for large datasets as it lacks schema and compression. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would improve write performance and reduce storage space. It also allows for easier integration with other Spark jobs and tools.",

      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC provides faster writes due to columnar storage and efficient compression. These formats also allow for schema evolution and easier integration with other Spark jobs and tools. The output file will be more compact and efficient to read in subsequent operations."
