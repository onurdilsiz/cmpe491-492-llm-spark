      "improvementExplanation": "The current map() operation performs a discount calculation on each individual sale record. This involves iterating over each element in the RDD, which can be inefficient for large datasets. By using mapPartitions(), we can process data in batches at the partition level, reducing the number of function calls and improving I/O efficiency.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "discounted_sales_rdd = sales_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: [(row[\"sale_id\"], row[\"category\"], row[\"amount\"] * 0.9) for row in partition])",
      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() offers several benefits:\n- **Reduced function call overhead:** By processing data in batches, we avoid the overhead of calling the discount function for each individual record.\n- **Optimized I/O:** Reading and processing data in larger chunks can improve I/O efficiency, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n- **Improved resource utilization:** Processing data at the partition level can lead to better resource utilization, as fewer tasks are required to complete the operation."
