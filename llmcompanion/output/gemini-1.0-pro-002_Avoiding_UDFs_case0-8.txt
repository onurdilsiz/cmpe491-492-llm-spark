**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of User-Defined Functions (UDFs). The code performs a simple word count operation using the `reduceByKey` transformation on an RDD. The `reduceByKey` function is a built-in Spark function that aggregates values based on a key.

Therefore, there are no UDFs to analyze or replace in this code.
