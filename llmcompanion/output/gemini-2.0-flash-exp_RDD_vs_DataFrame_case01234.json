            "improvementExplanation": "The RDD `map` operation is used to parse and transform the input string data. This can be more efficiently handled using DataFrames, which provide schema information and optimized execution plans. The `collect()` action pulls all data to the driver, which can be inefficient for large datasets.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import split, col, upper\n\ndf = spark.createDataFrame(rdd, StringType()).toDF(\"line\")\ndf_result = df.select(split(col(\"line\"), \",\").getItem(0).cast(\"int\").alias(\"id\"), upper(split(col(\"line\"), \",\").getItem(1)).alias(\"name\")).collect()\nprint(\"DataFrame Result:\", df_result)\n```",
            "benefits": "Using DataFrames allows Spark to optimize the execution plan, potentially reducing shuffling and improving performance. The schema is defined, which allows for type checking and better query optimization. The `collect()` action is still used here for demonstration, but in real-world scenarios, it should be avoided for large datasets. Instead, use DataFrame actions like `write` or `show`."

            "rddOperation": "repartitioned_df.rdd.getNumPartitions() (line 13)",
            "improvementExplanation": "Accessing the RDD of a DataFrame to get the number of partitions is not an RDD operation itself, but it indicates that the user is working with the underlying RDD. The `repartition(10)` operation is inefficient because it forces a full shuffle of the data, even if the number of partitions is not changing significantly. If the goal is to reduce the number of partitions, `coalesce` should be used instead.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\ncoalesced_df = df.coalesce(2)\nprint(\"Number of partitions after coalesce:\", coalesced_df.rdd.getNumPartitions())\n```",
            "benefits": "Using `coalesce` instead of `repartition` when reducing the number of partitions avoids a full shuffle, which is more efficient. `coalesce` tries to combine existing partitions, while `repartition` always creates new partitions and shuffles the data. This leads to better performance and resource utilization."

The schema is defined, which allows for type checking and better query optimization. DataFrame operations are vectorized, which can be more efficient than processing each element individually with an RDD `map`."
