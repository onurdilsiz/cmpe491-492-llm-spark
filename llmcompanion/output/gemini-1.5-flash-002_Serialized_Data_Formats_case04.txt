      "operation": "Reading customer data from a text file using spark.sparkContext.textFile(\"path/to/customers.txt\") at line 14.",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads customer data from a text file (\"path/to/customers.txt\") using the textFile method of SparkContext.  Text files are not optimized for Spark processing. They lack schema information, leading to inefficient parsing and data processing.  Switching to a columnar storage format like Parquet or ORC provides significant performance improvements. Parquet and ORC offer schema enforcement, compression, and support for predicate pushdown, resulting in faster query execution and reduced storage costs.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"CustomerDataProcessing\").master(\"local[*]\").getOrCreate()\n\n# Assuming customers.parquet exists, otherwise you'll need to write it first\ncustomer_df = spark.read.parquet(\"path/to/customers.parquet\")\n\nadult_customers_df = customer_df.filter(customer_df[\"age\"] >= 18)\nadult_customers_df.show()\n\nspark.stop()",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC offers several benefits:\n\n* **Faster Reads/Writes:** Columnar storage allows Spark to read only the necessary columns, significantly reducing I/O operations.\n* **Compression:** Parquet and ORC support efficient compression, reducing storage space and improving read performance.\n* **Schema Enforcement:**  Provides schema information, eliminating the need for parsing each row, leading to faster processing.\n* **Predicate Pushdown:** Enables the filter operation to be performed during the read process, further improving query performance."
