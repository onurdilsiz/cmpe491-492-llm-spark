      "operation": "The `as_block_matrix` function (lines 10-14) converts an RDD of vectors into an `IndexedRowMatrix` and then to a `BlockMatrix`.",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `as_block_matrix` function is a UDF that performs transformations on an RDD.  Spark's built-in functions and DataFrame/Dataset operations are optimized for distributed processing and can significantly improve performance compared to UDFs.  In this case, the conversion to `IndexedRowMatrix` and `BlockMatrix` can be achieved using Spark's `mllib` functionalities directly on the RDD without the need for a separate UDF.  However, the core RBM logic heavily relies on NumPy operations which are not directly compatible with Spark's distributed nature.  Therefore, a complete replacement is not straightforward and would require a significant restructuring of the RBM implementation to leverage Spark's distributed linear algebra capabilities more effectively.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "A direct replacement isn't feasible without rewriting the RBM algorithm to use Spark's distributed matrix operations more extensively.  The current use of `collect()` defeats the purpose of distributed computing.  A more efficient approach would involve using Spark's `mllib` libraries for matrix operations directly on the RDDs, avoiding the repeated `collect()` calls. This would require a substantial code refactoring.",
      "benefits": "Avoiding UDFs in this context would enable Catalyst optimizations, leading to improved performance by eliminating the overhead of Python serialization and deserialization.  It would also allow Spark to better parallelize the computations, potentially resulting in significant speedups for larger datasets.  The use of Spark's built-in matrix operations would be more efficient than manually managing blocks and performing operations on collected data."
