      "operation": "Line 68: airbnb_df.repartition(24)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(24) operation triggers a full shuffle, regardless of the current number of partitions.  If the goal is simply to reduce the number of partitions (e.g., for downstream operations), coalesce() is more efficient as it avoids unnecessary shuffling.  If the goal is to increase the number of partitions, repartition is necessary.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "If reducing partitions, replace with: \nairbnb_df.coalesce(numPartitions)",
      "benefits": "Reduced shuffling, improved resource usage, and faster job runtime."

      "improvementExplanation": "This operation can be vectorized using a DataFrame/Dataset operation, avoiding the overhead of a Python UDF.  mapPartitions would be beneficial if the calculation was more complex and involved external resources or batching.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "pred_df = pred_df.withColumn(\"difference\", (pred_df[\"price\"] - pred_df[\"prediction\"])**2)",

      "operation": "Line 41: airbnb_df = spark.read.format(\"delta\").load(f\"{absolute_dir_path}/imputed_results\")",
      "improvementExplanation": "While Delta Lake is an optimized format, if the source data is initially in CSV or JSON, reading it directly into a DataFrame and then writing it to Delta Lake would be beneficial.  Using Parquet or ORC directly would be even more efficient for initial reads.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "If the source data is CSV:\nparquet_df = spark.read.csv(f\"{absolute_dir_path}/imputed_results.csv\", header=True, inferSchema=True).write.parquet(f\"{absolute_dir_path}/imputed_results_parquet\")\n\nairbnb_df = spark.read.parquet(f\"{absolute_dir_path}/imputed_results_parquet\")",
