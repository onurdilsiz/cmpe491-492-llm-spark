      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation splits each line of the employee data.  This is an I/O-bound operation that can be improved by processing multiple lines within a partition at once. mapPartitions allows for batch processing of lines within each partition, reducing the overhead of repeatedly calling the lambda function for each line.",

      "operation": "bonus_rdd = high_salary_rdd.map(lambda emp: (emp[0], emp[1], float(emp[2]) * 1.1))",
      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation calculates bonuses for each high-salary employee.  While not strictly I/O bound, the per-record calculation can benefit from batching. mapPartitions allows processing multiple employee records within a partition simultaneously, reducing the overhead of repeatedly calling the lambda function for each employee.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "bonus_rdd = high_salary_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: ((emp[0], emp[1], float(emp[2]) * 1.1) for emp in iterator))",
      "benefits": "Reduced function call overhead by processing multiple employee records in a batch. Improved efficiency by minimizing the number of calls to the Python interpreter. Potentially better resource utilization."
