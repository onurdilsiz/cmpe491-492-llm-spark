            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads a text file into an RDD using spark.read.text.  This can be improved by directly reading the data into a DataFrame using a more efficient format like Parquet or ORC, or if the text file is structured, using spark.read.csv or spark.read.json with appropriate schema inference or definition. This allows Spark to leverage its optimized query engine for better performance.",

            "improvementExplanation": "The code uses repartition(1) before writing the data. Since the goal is to reduce the number of output files to 1, coalesce(1) is more efficient as it avoids a full shuffle. Repartition always triggers a full shuffle, regardless of the number of partitions.",
