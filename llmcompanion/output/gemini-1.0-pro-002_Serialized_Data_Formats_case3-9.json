            "improvementExplanation": "The current code reads data from a CSV file, which is a text-based format that is not optimized for Spark. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed and by allowing Spark to leverage its optimized data structures.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Load your dataset into a Spark DataFrame\ndf = spark.read.parquet('/Users/mac/Downloads/predictive.parquet')\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC would provide the following benefits:\n* **Faster reads/writes:** Parquet and ORC are columnar formats that allow Spark to read and write data much faster than CSV.\n* **Compression:** Parquet and ORC support compression, which can significantly reduce the amount of storage space required for the data.\n* **Query optimization:** Parquet and ORC allow Spark to perform predicate pushdown, which means that it can filter data at the file level before reading it into memory. This can significantly improve the performance of queries."
