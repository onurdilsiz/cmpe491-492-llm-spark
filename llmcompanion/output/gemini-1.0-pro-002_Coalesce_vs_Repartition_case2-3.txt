**Explanation:**

The provided code snippet uses `repartition(10)` to increase the number of partitions in the RDD. However, since the data is already partitioned by key, using `coalesce(10)` instead would achieve the same result without performing a full shuffle. This would reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred across the network, leading to improved performance.

The response provides a detailed explanation of why and how `repartition()` can be replaced with `coalesce()` in this case, along with a code snippet showing how to make the replacement. Additionally, it highlights the benefits of switching to `coalesce()`, such as reduced shuffling, improved resource usage, and potentially faster job runtime.
