            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame. However, since the subsequent write operation is saving the data to a single file (CSV), the increased number of partitions is not necessary. Replacing repartition() with coalesce() will reduce the number of partitions to the minimum required, improving resource utilization and potentially reducing job runtime.",

            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() will:\n- Reduce the number of partitions, leading to more efficient resource utilization.\n- Potentially reduce job runtime by avoiding unnecessary shuffling."
