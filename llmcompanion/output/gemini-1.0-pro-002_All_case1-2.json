            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame. However, since the subsequent write operation is saving the data to a single file (CSV), the increased number of partitions is not necessary. Instead, we can use coalesce() to reduce the number of partitions to 1, which will improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be shuffled.",

            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() will reduce the amount of data that needs to be shuffled, which will improve performance. Additionally, it will reduce the amount of resources used by the job."
