            "rddOperation": "textFile (line 16) and collect (line 17)",
            "improvementExplanation": "Reading a file directly into an RDD using `textFile` and then immediately calling `collect` to bring all data to the driver is inefficient, especially for large files. DataFrames provide optimized file reading and distributed processing.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nimport sys\n\ninput_file = sys.argv[1]\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"Quiz3\").getOrCreate()\ndf = spark.read.text(input_file)\n```",
            "benefits": "Faster file reading, avoids data transfer bottleneck to the driver.  Enables optimized execution plans and parallel processing."

        {
            "rddOperation": "flatMap (line 21)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `flatMap` operation on an RDD can be replaced with a DataFrame's `explode` function after splitting the text column. This leverages Spark's optimized execution engine for better performance.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\ndf = df.withColumn('words', split(df['value'], ' '))\ndf = df.select(explode('words').alias('word'))\n```",

            "rddOperation": "mapPartitions (lines 29-46) and reduce (line 50)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `mapPartitions` and `reduce` operations are inefficient for aggregations. DataFrames provide built-in aggregation functions that are highly optimized and leverage Spark's Catalyst optimizer.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import when, col, count, sum\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, IntegerType\n\ndf = df.withColumn(\"is_numeric\", when(regexp_replace(col(\"word\"), \"-\", \"\").rlike(\"[0-9]+\"), 1).otherwise(0))\ndf = df.withColumn(\"number\", when(col(\"is_numeric\") == 1, col(\"word\").cast(IntegerType())).otherwise(None))\n\naggregated_df = df.agg( \n    count(when(col(\"is_numeric\") == 1, col(\"word\"))).alias(\"C\"),\n    count(when(col(\"number\") == 0, col(\"number\"))).alias(\"Z\"),\n    count(when(col(\"number\") > 0, col(\"number\"))).alias(\"P\"),\n    count(when(col(\"number\") < 0, col(\"number\"))).alias(\"N\"),\n    count(when(col(\"is_numeric\") == 0, col(\"word\"))).alias(\"S\")\n)\nresult = aggregated_df.collect()[0]\nprint(tuple(result))\n```",
