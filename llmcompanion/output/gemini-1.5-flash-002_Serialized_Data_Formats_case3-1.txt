      "operation": "spark.read.option(\"delimiter\", \"|\").csv(conf[\"filepaths\"], inferSchema=True, header=True) at line 41",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from CSV files specified in `conf[\"filepaths\"]`. CSV is a text-based format, leading to slower read speeds and higher storage costs compared to binary formats like Parquet or ORC.  Parquet and ORC offer better compression, columnar storage for faster query processing, and support for predicate pushdown, significantly improving performance, especially for large datasets.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "parquet_df = spark.read.parquet(conf[\"filepaths\"])",
      "benefits": "Faster read speeds, reduced storage costs due to compression, improved query performance through columnar storage and predicate pushdown."
    },
    {
      "operation": "best_pipeline.save(conf[\"model_output_path\"]) at line 132",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code saves the trained pipeline model to the path specified in `conf[\"model_output_path\"]`.  The default format might be less efficient. Saving the model in Parquet or ORC format will enable faster loading and potentially better compression.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "best_pipeline.write.parquet(conf[\"model_output_path\"])",
      "benefits": "Faster model loading times, reduced storage space, and potentially better compatibility with other Spark jobs."
