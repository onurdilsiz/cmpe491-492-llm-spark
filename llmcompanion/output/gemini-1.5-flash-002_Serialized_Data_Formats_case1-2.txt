      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a CSV file, which is a text-based format.  CSV files are not optimized for storage or query performance in Spark.  They lack built-in compression and schema enforcement, leading to slower read/write operations and increased storage costs. Switching to Parquet or ORC provides significant performance gains due to their columnar storage, compression, and schema enforcement.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "parquet_df = spark.read.parquet(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/parquet-file\")\n# Subsequent operations on parquet_df",
      "benefits": "Faster read/write operations, reduced storage costs due to compression, improved query performance through predicate pushdown and columnar storage."

      "operation": "Writing CSV data to `hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/repartition/1` (lines 38-40)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code writes data to a CSV file using LZ4 compression. While LZ4 provides some compression, it's still less efficient than the columnar storage and compression offered by Parquet or ORC.  These formats offer better compression ratios and faster query performance due to their optimized storage structure.",

      "benefits": "Faster write operations, better compression leading to reduced storage costs, improved query performance for subsequent reads, and schema enforcement for data integrity."
