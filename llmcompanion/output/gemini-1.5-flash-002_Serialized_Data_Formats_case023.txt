      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads order data from a text file (orders.txt) using RDDs.  This is inefficient for large datasets.  Switching to Parquet or ORC would significantly improve performance.  Parquet and ORC are columnar storage formats that offer better compression and enable predicate pushdown, leading to faster query execution.  Reading the data directly into a DataFrame using the optimized format would also eliminate the need for manual parsing.",
