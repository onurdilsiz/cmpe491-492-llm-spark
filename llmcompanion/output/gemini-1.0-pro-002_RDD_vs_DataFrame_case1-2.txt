**Explanation:**

The provided code snippet does not use any RDDs. It exclusively utilizes DataFrames for data processing. Therefore, there are no RDD operations to analyze or replace with DataFrames/Datasets.

**Benefits of Using DataFrames/Datasets:**

While the provided code already leverages DataFrames, it's worth highlighting the advantages of using DataFrames/Datasets over RDDs:

- **Performance:** DataFrames/Datasets are optimized for query execution, leveraging Catalyst Optimizer for efficient query planning and execution. This leads to faster processing times compared to RDDs.
- **Scalability:** DataFrames/Datasets are designed to handle large datasets efficiently, scaling well across multiple nodes in a distributed cluster.
- **Resource Usage:** DataFrames/Datasets minimize data shuffling and unnecessary computations, leading to reduced resource consumption and improved cluster utilization.
- **Ease of Use:** DataFrames/Datasets provide a more intuitive and user-friendly API for data manipulation, making it easier to write and maintain code.
- **Integration with Spark SQL:** DataFrames/Datasets seamlessly integrate with Spark SQL, allowing you to combine SQL-like queries with DataFrame transformations for comprehensive data analysis.

By consistently using DataFrames/Datasets throughout your Spark code, you can achieve significant performance improvements, better scalability, and efficient resource utilization.
