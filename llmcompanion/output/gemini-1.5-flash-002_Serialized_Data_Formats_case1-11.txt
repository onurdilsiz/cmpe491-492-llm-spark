      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads configuration data from a JSON file.  JSON is a human-readable format but not optimized for Spark's processing. Switching to a more efficient format is not directly applicable here as it's configuration data, not the main dataset. However, storing configuration in a database or a more structured format could improve access speed and management.",

      "operation": "Reading and writing a NETCDF file in the process_netcdf function (lines 110-112, 146)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code downloads a NETCDF file from S3, processes it using Iris, and then deletes the temporary file.  NETCDF is not a columnar storage format optimized for Spark.  Instead of downloading the entire file and then deleting it, it's better to directly read the data from S3 into a Spark DataFrame using a format like Parquet or ORC.  This avoids the intermediate file I/O and allows for parallel processing.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nimport boto3\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import *\n\n# ... other code ...\ndef process_netcdf(file_name):\n    # ... other code ...\n    s3 = boto3.client('s3')\n    raw_data_bucket = get_bucket_links()\n    # Read directly from S3 into a Spark DataFrame\n    df = spark.read.format(\"netcdf\").option(\"fs\",\"s3a\").option(\"path\", f\"s3a://{raw_data_bucket}/{file_name}\").load()\n    # ... process the DataFrame ...\n    return dfs\n```",
