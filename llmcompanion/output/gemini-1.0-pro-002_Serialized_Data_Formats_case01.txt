    {
      "operation": "Reading data from a text file using `sparkContext.textFile()` (line 6)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Reading data from a text file is inefficient due to the need to parse each line individually. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC would allow Spark to read the data much faster, as it would only need to read the data once and then keep it in memory for subsequent operations.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read data from Parquet file\nsales_df = spark.read.parquet(\"path/to/sales.parquet\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Reading data from Parquet or ORC is significantly faster than reading from a text file. Additionally, Parquet and ORC support compression, which can further reduce the amount of data that needs to be read."
    },
    {
      "operation": "Writing data to a DataFrame using `toDF()` and `repartition()` (lines 13-15)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Writing data to a DataFrame using `toDF()` and `repartition()` is inefficient because it requires Spark to shuffle the data across nodes. This can be avoided by writing the data directly to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC.",
