```json
{
  "detected": false,
  "occurrences": 0,
  "response": []
}
```

**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of User-Defined Functions (UDFs). The code primarily demonstrates basic RDD operations, including creating an RDD from a list of strings, splitting strings into words using `flatMap`, and collecting elements from the RDDs.

Since no UDFs are present, there are no occurrences to analyze or potential replacements to suggest. The response object remains empty, reflecting the absence of UDF usage in the given code.
