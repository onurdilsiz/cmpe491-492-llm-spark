```json
{
  "detected": false,
  "occurrences": 0,
  "response": []
}
```

**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of User-Defined Functions (UDFs). The code primarily demonstrates basic RDD operations, including creating an RDD from a list of strings, printing elements, and performing a `flatMap` transformation to split strings into individual words.

Therefore, there are no UDFs to analyze or replace with built-in functions or native DataFrame/Dataset operations. The response object is empty, indicating that no UDFs were detected.
