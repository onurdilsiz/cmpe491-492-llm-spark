      "operation": "lambda line: line.split(',') in line 13",
      "improvementExplanation": "This UDF splits each line of the input text file into an array of strings.  This can be replaced by using Spark's built-in CSV parsing capabilities within a DataFrame.  Processing data as a DataFrame allows for optimized execution plans and parallel processing.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "employee_df = spark.read.csv('path/to/employees.txt', header=False, inferSchema=True)\nhigh_salary_df = employee_df.filter(employee_df[\"salary\"] > 50000)\nhigh_salary_count = high_salary_df.count()",
      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with DataFrame operations enables Catalyst optimizations, leading to improved performance and reduced serialization overhead.  DataFrames provide a more efficient and scalable way to handle large datasets compared to RDDs."
