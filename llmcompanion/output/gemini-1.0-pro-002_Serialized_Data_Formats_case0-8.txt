**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not perform any input/output operations. It creates an RDD from a list of tuples, performs a `reduceByKey` operation to count the occurrences of each word, and then prints the results. There are no file reads or writes involved in this process. Therefore, there are no opportunities to optimize input/output operations by switching to serialized data formats like Parquet or ORC.
