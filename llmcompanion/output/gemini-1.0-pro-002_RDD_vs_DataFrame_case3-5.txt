    {
      "rddOperation": "map",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `map` operation is used to transform each element of the RDD into a new element. This can be inefficient for complex transformations, as it requires iterating over the entire RDD. DataFrames/Datasets offer more efficient ways to perform transformations using vectorized operations.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\n# Assuming `joined` is a DataFrame\njoined = joined.withColumn(\"new_column\", F.expr(\"some_complex_transformation(column1, column2)\"))\n```",
      "benefits": "Using DataFrames/Datasets for transformations can improve performance by reducing the number of iterations and leveraging vectorized operations. This can lead to faster execution times and better resource utilization."

      "rddOperation": "filter",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `filter` operation is used to filter out elements from the RDD that do not meet a certain condition. This can be inefficient for large datasets, as it requires iterating over the entire RDD. DataFrames/Datasets offer more efficient ways to perform filtering using predicate pushdown.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\n# Assuming `joined` is a DataFrame\njoined = joined.filter(F.col(\"column1\") > 10)\n```",
      "benefits": "Using DataFrames/Datasets for filtering can improve performance by pushing the filtering logic down to the data source, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed. This can lead to faster execution times and better resource utilization."

This can be inefficient for large datasets, as it requires iterating over the entire RDD multiple times. DataFrames/Datasets offer more efficient ways to perform aggregations using optimized aggregation functions.",
