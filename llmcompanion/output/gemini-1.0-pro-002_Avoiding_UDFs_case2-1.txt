      "operation": "The UDF `is_number` is used on line 22 to count the total number of numbers, zeros, positive numbers, negative numbers, and non-numbers in each partition of the RDD.",
      "improvementExplanation": "This UDF can be replaced with a combination of Spark SQL functions and native DataFrame/Dataset operations. We can use the `filter` function to filter out non-numeric values, then use the `count` function to count the total number of numbers. We can further use the `sum` function with conditional expressions to count the number of zeros, positive numbers, and negative numbers.",

      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with built-in functions and native DataFrame/Dataset operations offers several benefits:\n\n* **Catalyst Optimizations:** Spark SQL can optimize the query plan using Catalyst, which can significantly improve performance compared to UDFs.\n* **Improved Performance:** Built-in functions and native operations are generally more efficient than UDFs, as they are optimized for Spark's execution engine.\n* **Reduced Serialization Overhead:** UDFs require serialization and deserialization, which can add overhead to data processing. Using built-in functions and native operations avoids this overhead."
