## Analysis

The provided code snippet does not contain any RDD operations. It only defines several user-defined functions (UDFs) using the `@udf` decorator. These UDFs are likely intended to be used within a DataFrame/Dataset context, as they are defined with the `returnType` argument and use Spark SQL functions like `split` and `lower`.

## Conclusion

Since no RDD operations were detected, there is no opportunity to replace them with DataFrames/Datasets for improved performance. The provided code snippet appears to be well-suited for working with DataFrames/Datasets, leveraging their optimized execution engine and efficient data structures.
