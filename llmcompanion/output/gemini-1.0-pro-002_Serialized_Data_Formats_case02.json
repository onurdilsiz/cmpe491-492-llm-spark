            "improvementExplanation": "The current approach reads the data line by line, which is inefficient for large datasets. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC would allow for faster reads and better compression.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read data from Parquet file\nparquet_df = spark.read.parquet(\"path/to/employees.parquet\")\n```",
            "benefits": "Using Parquet or ORC offers several benefits:\n- **Faster reads/writes:** Serialized formats are optimized for efficient data access.\n- **Compression:** They compress data effectively, reducing storage space and network transfer times.\n- **Query optimization:** Parquet and ORC support predicate pushdown, enabling faster queries by filtering data at the file level."
