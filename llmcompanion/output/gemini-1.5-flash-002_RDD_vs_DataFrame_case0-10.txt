    {
      "rddOperation": "rdd2=rdd.flatMap(lambda x: x.split(\" \")) (line 18)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The flatMap operation on RDDs involves a lot of data shuffling and serialization. DataFrames provide optimized execution plans and can perform this operation more efficiently using built-in functions.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ['text'])\ndf2 = df.select(explode(split(col('text'), ' ')).alias('word'))",
      "benefits": "DataFrames leverage Catalyst optimizer for better execution plans, reducing data shuffling and improving performance.  They also handle data serialization more efficiently."

      "rddOperation": "rdd3=rdd2.map(lambda x: (x,1)) (line 21)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to flatMap, the map operation on RDDs can be less efficient than DataFrame's built-in functions. DataFrames offer optimized processing and reduce the overhead associated with RDD transformations.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "df3 = df2.withColumn('count', lit(1))",

      "improvementExplanation": "reduceByKey is an RDD operation that requires significant data shuffling. DataFrames provide a more efficient way to perform aggregations using groupBy and agg functions, which are optimized for distributed processing.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "df4 = df3.groupBy('word').agg(sum('count').alias('sum'))",
