      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition(10)` operation is used to increase the number of partitions of the RDD to 10. Since the subsequent operation `foreachPartition` processes each partition independently, the goal is to parallelize the download and processing of links. However, if the initial number of partitions is less than or equal to 10, `repartition` will cause a full shuffle. If the initial number of partitions is greater than 10, `repartition` will still cause a shuffle. In this case, we are not increasing the number of partitions, but rather setting it to a specific number. If the initial number of partitions is greater than 10, we can use `coalesce` to reduce the number of partitions to 10 without a full shuffle. If the initial number of partitions is less than or equal to 10, `coalesce` will not cause a shuffle. Since we don't know the initial number of partitions, we can use `coalesce` to reduce the number of partitions to 10 if needed, or avoid a shuffle if the number of partitions is already less than or equal to 10.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": ".coalesce(10)",
      "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce(10)` can potentially avoid a full shuffle if the initial number of partitions is greater than 10, leading to reduced data movement across the network, improved resource utilization, and faster job runtime. If the initial number of partitions is less than or equal to 10, `coalesce` will not cause a shuffle, while `repartition` will cause a shuffle."
