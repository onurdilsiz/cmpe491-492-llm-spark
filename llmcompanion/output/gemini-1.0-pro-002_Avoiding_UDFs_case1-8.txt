```json
{
  "detected": false,
  "occurrences": 0,
  "response": []
}
```

**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of User-Defined Functions (UDFs). Therefore, the response indicates that no UDFs were detected and provides an empty array for the "response" field.

**Benefits of Avoiding UDFs:**

While UDFs can be useful in certain scenarios, they can also introduce performance overhead and limit optimization opportunities. By avoiding UDFs and utilizing Spark's built-in functions and native DataFrame/Dataset operations, you can achieve the following benefits:

- **Catalyst Optimizations:** Spark's Catalyst optimizer can effectively optimize queries that use built-in functions and native operations. This leads to improved query performance and reduced execution time.
- **Improved Performance:** Built-in functions and native operations are often implemented in a highly optimized manner, taking advantage of Spark's internal data structures and execution engine. This can result in significant performance gains compared to UDFs.
- **Reduced Serialization Overhead:** UDFs require serialization and deserialization, which can introduce overhead during data processing. By using built-in functions and native operations, you can avoid this overhead and improve the overall efficiency of your Spark applications.

**Conclusion:**

In the provided code, there are no UDFs to replace. However, it's important to keep in mind the benefits of avoiding UDFs whenever possible to optimize Spark applications for performance and efficiency.
