            "improvementExplanation": "The UDF `multiply_by_two` is used to multiply a column by 2. This operation can be directly performed using Spark's built-in arithmetic operations on DataFrame columns. Using a UDF prevents Spark's Catalyst optimizer from fully optimizing the query plan, leading to potential performance bottlenecks due to serialization and deserialization overhead.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "```python\nresult_without_udf = df.withColumn(\"doubled\", col(\"numbers\") * 2)\n```",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with a built-in operation allows Spark's Catalyst optimizer to fully optimize the query plan. This results in improved performance by avoiding serialization and deserialization overhead associated with UDFs. It also allows for more efficient execution through Spark's optimized execution engine."
