      "operation": "Reading data from text file at line 6: `rdd = spark.sparkContext.textFile(\"/apps/sparkbyexamples/src/pyspark-examples/data.txt\")`",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a text file, which is not an optimized format for Spark.  Text files lack schema information and are not compressed, leading to slower read times and increased storage costs. Switching to Parquet or ORC provides schema enforcement, compression, and efficient columnar storage, resulting in significant performance gains, especially for large datasets.  Parquet and ORC support predicate pushdown, allowing Spark to filter data at the storage level, further improving query performance.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName('SparkByExamples.com').getOrCreate()\ndf = spark.read.parquet(\"/path/to/your/parquet/data.parquet\")\n#Further operations on the DataFrame df\n```\nReplace \"/path/to/your/parquet/data.parquet\" with the actual path to your Parquet file.  You'll need to convert your data to Parquet format beforehand using `df.write.parquet(...)` where `df` is your DataFrame.",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC offers several benefits:\n* **Faster read/write speeds:** Columnar storage and compression significantly reduce I/O time.\n* **Improved compression:** Reduces storage space and network transfer costs.\n* **Schema enforcement:** Ensures data integrity and consistency.\n* **Predicate pushdown:** Enables Spark to filter data at the storage level, improving query performance.\n* **Better handling of complex data types:** Supports nested structures and various data types more efficiently than text files."
