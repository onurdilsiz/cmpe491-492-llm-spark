            "improvementExplanation": "The current code reads data from a text file in CSV format. This format is not optimized for Spark processing, as it requires parsing and deserialization for each record. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve performance by reducing parsing overhead and enabling columnar storage.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nforms = spark.read.parquet('hdfs:///user/carrdp/FinanceML/13F/Q12015/links10.parquet')\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC would provide the following benefits:\n* **Faster reads/writes:** Serialized formats like Parquet and ORC are optimized for Spark processing, resulting in faster read and write operations.\n* **Compression:** These formats compress data efficiently, reducing storage space and network transfer times.\n* **Query optimization:** Parquet and ORC support predicate pushdown, which allows Spark to filter data at the file level, further improving query performance."
