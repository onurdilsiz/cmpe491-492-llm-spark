            "improvementExplanation": "Accessing the RDD to get the number of partitions is not an operation that needs to be replaced, but the repartition operation itself is inefficient. The repartition operation is used to increase the number of partitions, which can lead to unnecessary shuffling. If the goal is to reduce the number of partitions, coalesce should be used instead.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "If the goal is to reduce the number of partitions, use coalesce instead of repartition. If the goal is to increase the number of partitions, repartition is the correct operation, but it should be used only when necessary.",
            "benefits": "Using coalesce when reducing the number of partitions avoids a full shuffle, which is more efficient than repartition. If the goal is to increase the number of partitions, repartition is the correct operation, but it should be used only when necessary."

            "rddOperation": "sales_rdd.map(lambda row: (row[\"sale_id\"], row[\"category\"], row[\"amount\"] * 0.9)) (line 23)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `map` operation on the RDD is performing element-wise processing, which can be inefficient. DataFrames provide optimized operations for such transformations, allowing Spark to leverage its query optimizer and perform operations more efficiently.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\ndiscounted_sales_df = repartitioned_df.withColumn(\"discounted_amount\", repartitioned_df[\"amount\"] * 0.9)\n```",
            "benefits": "Using `withColumn` on the DataFrame allows Spark to optimize the transformation. It avoids the overhead of RDD operations, leverages the Catalyst optimizer, and can potentially reduce shuffling. DataFrames also provide better type safety and schema awareness, leading to more robust code."
