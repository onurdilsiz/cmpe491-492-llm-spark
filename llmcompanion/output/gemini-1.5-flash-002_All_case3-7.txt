      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a CSV file using pandas.  Pandas is not designed for distributed processing.  Spark's DataFrame API provides efficient distributed reading of data, especially when using optimized formats like Parquet.  Reading directly into a Spark DataFrame allows for parallel processing and leveraging Spark's optimizations.",
