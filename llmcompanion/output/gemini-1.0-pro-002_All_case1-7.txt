      "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used to distribute the DataFrame into a specified number of partitions. However, in this case, the DataFrame is already distributed based on the '_salted_key' column, which ensures a balanced distribution. Therefore, we can replace repartition() with coalesce() to reduce the number of partitions without affecting the distribution.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "df = df.coalesce(number_of_files)",
      "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() will reduce shuffling, improve resource utilization, and potentially speed up job execution."
