      "improvementExplanation": "This UDF can be replaced with Spark's built-in `corr` function, which calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient between two columns. The `corr` function is optimized for performance and leverages Catalyst for efficient execution.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "```python\nmoviePairSimilarities = moviePairRatings.mapValues(lambda ratings: corr(ratings[0], ratings[1]))\n```",
      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with `corr` enables Catalyst optimizations, improves performance, and reduces serialization overhead."

      "operation": "filterDuplicates function (line 17)",
      "improvementExplanation": "This UDF can be replaced with a native DataFrame/Dataset operation using the `filter` method with a lambda function to compare movie IDs. This approach avoids the overhead of defining and calling a separate UDF.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "```python\nuniqueJoinedRatings = joinedRatings.filter(lambda x: x[1][0][0] < x[1][1][0])\n```",
