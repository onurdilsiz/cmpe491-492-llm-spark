            "improvementExplanation": "The current code uses `flatMap` to split each element in the RDD into words. This involves iterating over each element individually and applying the `split` function. However, this can be inefficient for large datasets as it incurs significant function call overhead and potentially redundant I/O operations. Replacing `flatMap` with `mapPartitions` allows us to process data in batches at the partition level, reducing function call overhead and potentially improving I/O efficiency.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "rdd2 = rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: (word for line in partition for word in line.split(\" \")))",
            "benefits": "Switching to `mapPartitions` offers several benefits:\n\n* **Reduced function call overhead:** By processing data in batches, we avoid the overhead of calling the `split` function for each individual element.\n* **Optimized I/O:** Reading and processing data in larger chunks can improve I/O efficiency, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n* **Improved resource utilization:** Processing data in parallel across partitions can lead to better resource utilization and faster execution times."
