    {
      "operation": "ApplyMapping_node2 = ApplyMapping.apply(frame=KinesisStream_node1, mappings=[...], transformation_ctx=\"ApplyMapping_node2\")",
      "improvementExplanation": "The ApplyMapping_node2 operation involves applying a series of transformations to each record in the DataFrame. This is a good candidate for using mapPartitions() instead of map() because it allows us to process multiple records at a time, potentially improving performance by reducing function call overhead and optimizing I/O operations.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "ApplyMapping_node2 = KinesisStream_node1.mapPartitions(lambda partition: partition.map(lambda record: ApplyMapping.apply(frame=record, mappings=[...], transformation_ctx=\"ApplyMapping_node2\")))",
      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() in this case can potentially lead to:\n- Reduced function call overhead: By processing multiple records at a time, we can reduce the number of times the ApplyMapping function is called, leading to improved performance.\n- Optimized I/O operations: mapPartitions() allows us to read and write data in larger chunks, which can improve I/O efficiency.\n- Improved resource utilization: By processing data in parallel, we can make better use of available resources."
