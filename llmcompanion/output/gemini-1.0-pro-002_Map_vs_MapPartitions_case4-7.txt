      "operation": "The map() operation is used in the ApplyMapping_node2 transformation on line 24 of the code.",
      "improvementExplanation": "The map() operation in this case is applied to each individual record in the DataFrame. However, the transformation involves adding new columns based on existing values and performing string manipulations. These operations can be efficiently performed at the partition level using mapPartitions(). This would reduce the number of function calls and improve I/O efficiency by processing data in batches.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\nApplyMapping_node2 = ApplyMapping.apply(\n    frame=KinesisStream_node1,\n    mappings=[...]\n)\n\n# Replace map() with mapPartitions()\ndef process_partition(partition):\n    for row in partition:\n        row['time'] = MAP_TIME(row['time'])\n        row['severity_id'] = MAP_SEVID(row['severity'])\n        # ... (other transformations)\n        yield row\n\nApplyMapping_node2 = ApplyMapping_node2.mapPartitions(process_partition)\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() in this case would provide the following benefits:\n* **Reduced function call overhead:** By processing data in batches, mapPartitions() reduces the number of function calls required, leading to improved performance.\n* **Optimized I/O:** Processing data in batches allows for more efficient I/O operations, as data can be read and written in larger chunks.\n* **Improved resource utilization:** By reducing the number of function calls and optimizing I/O, mapPartitions() can improve resource utilization and reduce overall processing time."
