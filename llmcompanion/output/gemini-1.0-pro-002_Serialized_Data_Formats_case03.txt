      "operation": "Reading data from a text file using RDD (line 6)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Reading data from a text file using RDD is inefficient and can be optimized by using DataFrame/Dataset API. Additionally, the data format can be changed from text to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC for faster reads and compression.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read data from a text file using DataFrame API\nemployee_df = spark.read.text(\"path/to/employees.txt\")\n# Parse the data into structured format\nemployee_df = employee_df.withColumn(\"employee_id\", F.split(F.col(\"value\"), \",\")[0])\n.withColumn(\"name\", F.split(F.col(\"value\"), \",\")[1])\n.withColumn(\"department\", F.split(F.col(\"value\"), \",\")[2])\n.withColumn(\"salary\", F.split(F.col(\"value\"), \",\")[3])\n```",
