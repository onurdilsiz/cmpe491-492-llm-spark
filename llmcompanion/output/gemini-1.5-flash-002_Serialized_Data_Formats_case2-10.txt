      "operation": "Reading CSV data from input_file using sc.textFile(). Location: lines 118-120 and 123-125.",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a CSV file using Spark's `textFile()` method.  CSV is a text-based format, leading to slower read speeds and increased storage compared to binary formats like Parquet or ORC.  Parquet and ORC offer better compression, schema enforcement, and support for predicate pushdown, resulting in faster query execution and reduced storage costs.  Switching to Parquet or ORC would involve reading the data using `spark.read.parquet()` or `spark.read.orc()` respectively, and writing the data using `dataframe.write.parquet()` or `dataframe.write.orc()`.  The existing data transformation steps would remain largely unchanged.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"Apriori\").getOrCreate()\nif case_number == 1:\n    user_basket = spark.read.csv(input_file, header=False, inferSchema=True).selectExpr(\"_c0\", \"_c1\").groupBy(\"_c0\").agg(F.collect_set(\"_c1\")).selectExpr(\"collect_set(_c1)\")\nif case_number == 2:\n    user_basket = spark.read.csv(input_file, header=False, inferSchema=True).selectExpr(\"_c1\", \"_c0\").groupBy(\"_c1\").agg(F.collect_set(\"_c0\")).selectExpr(\"collect_set(_c0)\")\n# ... rest of the code (adaptations needed for Spark DataFrame)\n# ... write to parquet or orc at the end\n```",

      "improvementExplanation": "The code writes the results to a text file using a custom format. This is inefficient compared to writing to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC.  Parquet and ORC provide better compression, faster write speeds, and efficient schema enforcement.
