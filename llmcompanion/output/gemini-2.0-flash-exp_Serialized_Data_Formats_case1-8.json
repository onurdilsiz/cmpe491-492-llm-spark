            "improvementExplanation": "The code currently reads data in Delta format. While Delta is an optimized format, it's beneficial to consider Parquet or ORC as alternatives, especially if the data is not being updated frequently or if the specific features of Delta are not required. Parquet and ORC are columnar formats that offer efficient compression and predicate pushdown, which can significantly improve read performance, especially for analytical workloads. Switching to Parquet or ORC can be beneficial if the data is primarily read and not frequently updated.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "spark.read.format(\"parquet\").load(f\"{absolute_dir_path}/imputed_results\")",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC offers several benefits: faster read times due to columnar storage and predicate pushdown, better compression, and reduced storage costs. Parquet and ORC are also widely supported and can be used with other data processing tools."
