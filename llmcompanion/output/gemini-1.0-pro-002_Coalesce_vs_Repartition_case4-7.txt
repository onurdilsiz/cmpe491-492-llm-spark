      "operation": "azureAuditLog_df_dynf = azureAuditLog_df_dynf.repartition(1)",
      "improvementExplanation": "This repartition() operation is used to reduce the number of partitions to 1. However, since the subsequent write operation to S3 does not require a shuffle, using coalesce() instead of repartition() would be more efficient. Coalesce() would simply merge the existing partitions without shuffling the data, resulting in reduced processing time and resource usage.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "azureAuditLog_df_dynf = azureAuditLog_df_dynf.coalesce(1)",
      "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() in this case would provide the following benefits:\n- Reduced shuffling: Coalesce() avoids unnecessary data shuffling, which can significantly improve performance.\n- Improved resource usage: Coalesce() requires less memory and CPU resources compared to repartition().\n- Faster runtime: By eliminating the shuffle step, coalesce() can lead to a faster overall job execution time."
