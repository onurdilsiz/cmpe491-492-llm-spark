            "operation": "Reading CSV data using `spark.read.csv(path)`",
            "improvementExplanation": "The code currently reads data from a CSV file. CSV is a row-based format, which is not efficient for analytical queries. Reading CSV files involves parsing each row, which can be slow. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance, especially when only a subset of columns is needed. Parquet also supports schema evolution and predicate pushdown, which can further optimize query execution.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n    # Assuming the path variable is defined as before\n    df = spark.read.parquet(path.replace('.csv', '.parquet'))\n    # If the file is not already in parquet format, you need to convert it first\n    # df = spark.read.csv(path)\n    # df.write.parquet(path.replace('.csv', '.parquet'))\n    # df = spark.read.parquet(path.replace('.csv', '.parquet'))\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet offers faster read times due to its columnar storage, which allows Spark to read only the necessary columns. It also provides compression, reducing storage space and I/O overhead. Additionally, Parquet supports predicate pushdown, enabling Spark to filter data at the storage layer, further improving query performance."

            "operation": "Writing CSV data using `filtered_df.write.csv(output_path)`",
            "improvementExplanation": "The code writes the filtered data back to a CSV file. Similar to reading, writing to CSV is inefficient due to its row-based nature and lack of compression. Switching to Parquet or ORC would improve write performance and reduce storage space. Parquet is generally preferred for its better support for schema evolution and predicate pushdown.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n    output_path = \"file:///root/filtered_data_team_2_clean/\"\n    filtered_df.write \\\n        .mode('overwrite') \\\n        .parquet(output_path.replace('.csv', '.parquet'))\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet for writing provides faster write times due to its columnar storage and compression. It also reduces storage space and I/O overhead. Furthermore, if the output is used for further processing, Parquet's columnar nature and predicate pushdown capabilities will improve the performance of subsequent read operations."
