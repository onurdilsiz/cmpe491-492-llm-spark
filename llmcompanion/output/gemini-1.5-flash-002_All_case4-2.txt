      "operation": "The code uses the `create_standard_df()` function which likely reads data from a CSV or other non-optimized format.  The exact location is not shown but it's implied by the function call on line 11.",
      "improvementExplanation": "Reading data directly from CSV into a DataFrame is inefficient.  Using a columnar storage format like Parquet significantly improves read performance, compression, and enables predicate pushdown for better query optimization.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "Assuming `create_standard_df()` reads from a CSV file named 'data.csv':\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"OptimizedRead\").getOrCreate()\ndf = spark.read.parquet('data.parquet') # Assuming data is already in parquet format\n#If not, convert CSV to Parquet first:\n#spark.read.csv('data.csv').write.parquet('data.parquet')\n```",
