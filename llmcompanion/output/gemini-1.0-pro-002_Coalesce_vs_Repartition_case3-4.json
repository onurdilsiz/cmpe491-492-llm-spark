            "improvementExplanation": "In this case, repartition() is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame to 1000. However, since the subsequent write operation partitions the data by year and month, it is more efficient to use coalesce() to reduce the number of partitions to the desired level (e.g., 100) before writing. This will minimize unnecessary shuffling and improve resource utilization.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df_trip = df_trip.coalesce(100)",
            "benefits": "Replacing repartition() with coalesce() in this case will:\n- Reduce shuffling, as coalesce() only merges partitions without a full shuffle.\n- Improve resource utilization, as fewer partitions require less memory and processing power.\n- Potentially speed up the write operation, as fewer partitions can be written in parallel."
