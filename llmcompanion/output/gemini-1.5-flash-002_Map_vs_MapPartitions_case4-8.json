            "improvementExplanation": "The `URLs2domain` UDF uses a list comprehension, which is functionally equivalent to a `map` operation.  This operation iterates over a list of URLs.  If the `urls` list is large, processing it within each partition using `mapPartitions` can be more efficient.  `mapPartitions` allows processing multiple URLs within a single function call per partition, reducing the overhead of repeatedly calling the Python function for each individual URL. This is particularly beneficial if `__URL2domain` involves network I/O or other expensive operations.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\n@udf(ArrayType(StringType()))\ndef URLs2domain(urls: List[str]) -> List[str]:\n    \"\"\"Trims a list of URLs and leaves only the root domains.\"\"\"\ndef process_partition(iterator):\n    for urls_partition in iterator:\n        yield [__URL2domain(url) for url in urls_partition]\n    \n    return process_partition\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to `mapPartitions` offers several advantages: \n\n* **Reduced function call overhead:** Instead of calling `__URL2domain` for each URL individually, it's called once per partition, significantly reducing the overhead, especially for large datasets.\n* **Improved I/O efficiency:** If `get_tld` involves network I/O, batching the requests within a partition can improve efficiency by reducing the number of network calls.\n* **Better resource utilization:** Processing multiple URLs within a partition can lead to better utilization of CPU and memory resources."
