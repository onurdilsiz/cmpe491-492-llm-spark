            "improvementExplanation": "The code uses `repartition(10)` to increase the number of partitions from the default to 10. Since the subsequent operations do not require a specific number of partitions and the goal is not to increase parallelism, this is an unnecessary full shuffle. If the goal was to reduce the number of partitions, `coalesce()` would be more efficient as it avoids a full shuffle when reducing the number of partitions. In this case, since the number of partitions is being increased, `coalesce()` cannot be used directly to achieve the same effect. However, if the goal was to reduce the number of partitions, `coalesce()` would be a better choice.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "If the goal was to reduce the number of partitions, for example to 2, the following code would be more efficient: `coalesced_df = sales_df.coalesce(2)`",
            "benefits": "If the goal was to reduce the number of partitions, using `coalesce()` would avoid a full shuffle, leading to reduced data movement across the network, lower resource consumption, and faster job execution. However, since the goal was to increase the number of partitions, `coalesce()` cannot be used directly to achieve the same effect. In this specific case, `repartition()` is the correct choice if the goal is to increase the number of partitions."
