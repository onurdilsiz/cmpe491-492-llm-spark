            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads a CSV file using pandas.read_csv(), which can be inefficient for large datasets. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve read performance due to columnar storage, compression, and optimized file formats.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read the wine-quality data from Parquet format\nwine_data = spark.read.parquet(wine_path)\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC offers several benefits:\n* **Faster reads:** Columnar storage allows for efficient data access by only reading the required columns, reducing I/O operations.\n* **Compression:** Parquet and ORC use efficient compression algorithms, reducing storage space and network transfer times.\n* **Query optimization:** Predicate pushdown allows filtering data at the file level, further improving query performance."
