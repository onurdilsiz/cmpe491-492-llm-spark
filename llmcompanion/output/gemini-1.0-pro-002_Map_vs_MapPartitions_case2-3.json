            "operation": "map(lambda line: line.split(' ')) in word_count() function on line 10",
            "improvementExplanation": "This map operation splits each line of text into words, which is a batching operation that can be performed more efficiently at the partition level using mapPartitions(). This would reduce the number of function calls and improve I/O performance.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\nwc = sc.textFile(word_file).\n    flatMap(lambda line: line.split(\" \")).\n    mapPartitions(lambda partition: map(lambda line: (line, 1), partition)).\n    reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a + b)\n```",
            "benefits": "Replacing map() with mapPartitions() in this case would:\n- Reduce function call overhead by processing data in batches within partitions.\n- Optimize I/O by reading and processing data in larger chunks.\n- Improve resource utilization by reducing the number of tasks and executors needed."
