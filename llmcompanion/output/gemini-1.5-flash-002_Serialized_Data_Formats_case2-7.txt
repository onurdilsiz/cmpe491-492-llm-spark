      "operation": "Reading data from 'data-2.txt' using sc.textFile() at line 30.",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a text file ('data-2.txt').  Text files are not optimized for Spark processing. They lack features like columnar storage, compression, and metadata that can significantly speed up data loading and query execution. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC will improve performance by enabling predicate pushdown, reducing I/O operations, and providing better compression.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "Assuming 'data-2.txt' can be converted to Parquet format (e.g., using Spark's `to_parquet` function or other tools), the optimized code would be:\n```python\nfrom pyspark import SparkContext, SparkConf\nimport numpy as np\nimport time\n\n# ... (Spark configuration remains the same)\n\n# Read Parquet data\ndata = sc.read.parquet(\"data-2.parquet\").rdd.map(lambda row: [float(x) for x in row])\n# ... (rest of the code remains the same)\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet offers several benefits:\n* **Faster Reads/Writes:** Parquet's columnar storage allows reading only the necessary columns, significantly reducing I/O operations.\n* **Compression:** Parquet supports various compression codecs, reducing storage space and improving read/write speeds.\n* **Predicate Pushdown:** Parquet's metadata enables Spark to filter data before reading it from disk, further improving query performance.\n* **Schema Enforcement:** Parquet enforces schema, leading to better data quality and easier data manipulation."
