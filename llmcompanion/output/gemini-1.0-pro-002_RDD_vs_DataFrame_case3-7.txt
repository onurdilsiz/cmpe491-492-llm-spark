**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not use any RDDs. It exclusively utilizes DataFrames for data manipulation and analysis. Therefore, there are no opportunities to replace RDDs with DataFrames for performance improvement.

**Benefits of Using DataFrames:**

While the provided code already leverages DataFrames, it's worth highlighting the advantages of using DataFrames over RDDs:

- **Performance:** DataFrames offer significant performance improvements over RDDs due to optimized query execution plans and reduced data shuffling.
- **Scalability:** DataFrames are designed to handle large datasets efficiently, making them ideal for big data applications.
- **Ease of Use:** DataFrames provide a more intuitive and user-friendly API compared to RDDs, simplifying data manipulation and analysis.
- **Rich Functionality:** DataFrames offer a wide range of built-in functions for data transformation, aggregation, and analysis, reducing the need for custom code.
- **Integration with Spark MLlib:** DataFrames seamlessly integrate with Spark MLlib, enabling efficient machine learning workflows.

By utilizing DataFrames, the provided code benefits from these advantages, ensuring efficient and scalable data analysis.
