            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads transaction data from a text file (\"path/to/transactions.txt\") using RDDs.  Text files are not optimized for Spark processing.  They lack schema information, leading to inefficient parsing and data processing.  Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC provides schema enforcement, compression, and optimized data access, significantly improving performance.  Parquet and ORC support predicate pushdown, enabling Spark to filter data at the storage level, reducing the amount of data read into memory.",

            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC offers several benefits:\n* **Faster Reads/Writes:** Columnar storage allows Spark to read only the necessary columns, reducing I/O operations.\n* **Compression:** Parquet and ORC support efficient compression, reducing storage space and improving read/write speeds.\n* **Schema Enforcement:**  Provides schema information, leading to more efficient data processing and error detection.\n* **Predicate Pushdown:** Enables filtering data at the storage level, reducing data transferred to the driver and executors."
