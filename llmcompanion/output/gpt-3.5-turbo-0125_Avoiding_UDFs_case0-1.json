            "operation": "computeCosineSimilarity function",
            "improvementExplanation": "The computeCosineSimilarity function is a UDF used to calculate the cosine similarity between two vectors. This UDF can be replaced with Spark's built-in functions for vector operations, such as dot product and norm calculations, to leverage optimized implementations and improve performance.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "Replace the computeCosineSimilarity function with Spark's built-in functions for vector operations. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.ml.linalg import Vectors\n\n# Compute cosine similarity using built-in functions\n\ndef computeCosineSimilarity(ratingPairs):\n    vectorX = Vectors.dense([ratingX for ratingX, _ in ratingPairs])\n    vectorY = Vectors.dense([ratingY for _, ratingY in ratingPairs])\n    similarity = vectorX.dot(vectorY) / (vectorX.norm(2) * vectorY.norm(2))\n    return (similarity, len(ratingPairs))\n```",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with built-in functions allows Spark to optimize the vector operations using its internal optimizations, leading to better performance. Additionally, using native functions can reduce serialization overhead and leverage Catalyst optimizations for query planning and execution."
