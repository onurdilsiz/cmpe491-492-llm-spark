      "operation": "df_trip = df_trip.repartition(1000)",
      "improvementExplanation": "This repartition() operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame to 1000. However, since the subsequent write operation partitions the data by year and month, it is unnecessary to repartition the DataFrame beforehand. Using coalesce() instead would avoid an unnecessary shuffle and potentially improve performance.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "df_trip = df_trip.coalesce(1000)",
      "benefits": "Replacing repartition() with coalesce() in this case would:\n- Reduce shuffling, as coalesce() only redistributes data within existing partitions.\n- Improve resource usage, as coalesce() avoids creating unnecessary partitions.\n- Potentially speed up the job runtime, as coalesce() is generally faster than repartition()."
