            "improvementExplanation": "The `map` operation here splits each line of the input text file by comma. This operation can be performed more efficiently at the partition level using `mapPartitions`. Instead of applying the split function to each line individually, `mapPartitions` allows us to process all lines within a partition at once. This reduces the overhead of calling the lambda function for each line and can be more efficient, especially for large datasets.",
