    {
      "rddOperation": "customer_rdd.map(lambda line: line.split(\",\")) (line 15)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The RDD map operation is inefficient for this task because it processes data in a row-by-row manner without leveraging Spark's optimized execution engine.  DataFrames provide built-in schema enforcement and optimization opportunities.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "customer_df = spark.read.csv(\"path/to/customers.txt\", header=False, inferSchema=True)\ncustomer_df = customer_df.withColumnRenamed('_c0', 'customer_id').withColumnRenamed('_c1', 'name').withColumnRenamed('_c2', 'age').withColumnRenamed('_c3', 'city')",
      "benefits": "Using DataFrame's CSV reading capabilities avoids manual parsing and enables Spark's optimized query execution plan, leading to significant performance gains, especially on large datasets.  It also provides schema enforcement and data type handling."

    {
      "rddOperation": "adult_customers_rdd.filter(lambda cust: int(cust[2]) >= 18) (line 16)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the map operation, the RDD filter is less efficient than DataFrame's built-in filtering capabilities. DataFrames allow for optimized filtering using predicate pushdown and other optimizations.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "adult_customer_df = customer_df.filter(customer_df[\"age\"] >= 18)",
      "benefits": "DataFrame's filter operation leverages Catalyst optimizer for efficient execution.  It pushes down the filter condition to the data source, reducing data transfer and processing time. This results in better performance and resource utilization."
