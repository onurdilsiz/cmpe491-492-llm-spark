            "improvementExplanation": "The `lemmaMapper` UDF processes each partition to lemmatize text using CoreNLP. This can be improved by using Spark's built-in functions for text processing if available, or by optimizing the CoreNLP integration for better parallelization within Spark.  If CoreNLP's functionality can't be directly replaced, consider exploring ways to improve its integration with Spark for better performance, such as using a custom Spark executor that includes CoreNLP.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "This requires a significant rewrite depending on the capabilities of alternative libraries.  If a suitable replacement for CoreNLP's functionality exists within Spark's ecosystem (e.g., a library offering lemmatization), that library should be used.  Otherwise, the CoreNLP integration needs optimization for Spark.  Example (assuming a hypothetical Spark-compatible lemmatizer):\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import udf\nfrom some_spark_compatible_lemmatizer import lemmatize_text # Hypothetical function\n\nlemmatize_udf = udf(lemmatize_text, ArrayType(StringType()))\n\nlemmatized = plainText.withColumn(\"lemmas\", lemmatize_udf(col(\"text\")))\n```",
            "benefits": "Replacing or optimizing the UDF allows Spark's Catalyst optimizer to generate more efficient execution plans, leading to improved performance and reduced resource consumption.  It also reduces the serialization overhead associated with transferring data between the driver and executors."

            "improvementExplanation": "The `topTermsInTopConcepts` UDF processes the SVD results to find top terms. This can be replaced by using Spark's built-in functions for array manipulation and sorting.  The current implementation uses Python's `map` and `sorted`, which are not optimized for distributed processing.",

            "benefits": "Using Spark's built-in functions enables Catalyst optimizations, resulting in significantly improved performance, especially for large datasets.  It avoids the overhead of transferring data to the driver for processing and then back to the executors."
