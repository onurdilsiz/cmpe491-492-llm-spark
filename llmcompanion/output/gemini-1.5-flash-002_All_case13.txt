      "improvementExplanation": "The code accesses the RDD using repartitioned_df.rdd.  This is unnecessary and can be avoided by using DataFrame/Dataset operations.  DataFrames provide optimized execution plans and better integration with Spark's query optimizer.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "repartitioned_df.rdd.getNumPartitions() can be replaced with repartitioned_df.rdd.getNumPartitions() which is already a DataFrame operation.  If you need the number of partitions, use repartitioned_df.rdd.getNumPartitions().  However, direct access to the underlying RDD should be avoided whenever possible.",
      "benefits": "Improved performance due to optimized execution plans and reduced overhead. Easier integration with other DataFrame/Dataset operations."
