      "operation": "azureAuditLog_df = azureAuditLog_df.withColumn(\"time\", MAP_TIME(col('time')).cast('integer'))",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `MAP_TIME` UDF is applied to each row individually using `withColumn`. This can be inefficient as it involves calling the UDF for every single record. Since the time conversion logic can be applied to a batch of records, `mapPartitions` can be used to process the time conversion in batches, reducing the overhead of calling the UDF for each row.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\ndef map_time_partition(iterator):\n    for row in iterator:\n        string = row['time'][:-2]\n        date_time = datetime.datetime.strptime(string, \"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f\")\n        date_time = datetime.datetime(date_time.year, date_time.month, date_time.day, date_time.hour, date_time.minute, date_time.second)\n        date_time = int(time.mktime(date_time.timetuple()))\n        yield Row(**row.asDict(), time=date_time)\n\nazureAuditLog_df = azureAuditLog_df.mapPartitions(map_time_partition).withColumn('time', col('time').cast('integer'))\n```",
