The overhead of creating iterators for each partition might outweigh the benefits in this specific case. While technically possible, the performance gain is unlikely to be substantial.",

            "improvementExplanation": "This map operation swaps the key and value in each tuple.  Like the previous map, this is a lightweight operation, and the overhead of mapPartitions might outweigh the benefits. The sortByKey operation is a shuffle operation and dominates the cost, making the map operation's optimization less impactful.",
