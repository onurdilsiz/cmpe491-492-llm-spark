            "improvementExplanation": "The current code reads data from a structured format, which could be optimized by using a serialized format like Parquet or ORC. These formats offer faster reads/writes, compression, and query optimization through predicate pushdown.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read data from Parquet file\nsales_df = spark.read.parquet(\"sales_data.parquet\")\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC would provide the following benefits:\n- Faster reads/writes due to columnar storage and compression.\n- Reduced data size due to compression.\n- Improved query performance through predicate pushdown, where filters can be applied directly on compressed data."
