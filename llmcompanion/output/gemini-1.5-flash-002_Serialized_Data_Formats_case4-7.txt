      "operation": "Reading JSON data from a Kinesis stream (lines 30-40)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads JSON data from a Kinesis stream using the GlueContext. The JSON format is not optimized for storage and processing in Spark.  Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC will significantly improve performance due to better compression, faster read/write speeds, and support for predicate pushdown.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "This requires a change in the Kinesis data source to output Parquet or ORC directly.  If that's not possible, a transformation step would be needed after reading from Kinesis to convert to Parquet/ORC.  Example (assuming Parquet):\n```python\ndataframe_KinesisStream_node1 = glueContext.create_data_frame.from_options(\n    connection_type=\"kinesis\",\n    connection_options={\n        \"typeOfData\": \"kinesis\",\n        \"streamARN\": SECURITY_LAKE_AZURE_STREAM_ARN,\n        \"classification\": \"json\",\n        \"startingPosition\": \"earliest\",\n        \"inferSchema\": \"true\",\n    },\n    transformation_ctx=\"dataframe_KinesisStream_node1\",\n)\n\n# Convert to Parquet\nparquet_df = dataframe_KinesisStream_node1.toDF().write.parquet(args[\"TempDir\"] + \"/kinesis_parquet\")\n# ... rest of the processing using parquet_df\n```",
      "benefits": "Faster read/write speeds, better compression, and support for predicate pushdown leading to faster query execution."

    {
      "operation": "Writing data to S3 in Glue Parquet format (lines 196-211)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code writes data to S3 in Glue Parquet format with gzip compression. While Parquet is a columnar format offering performance benefits, further optimization might be possible depending on the data characteristics and query patterns.  Using ORC might offer better compression in some cases, and ensuring appropriate partitioning and data organization in S3 is crucial for optimal performance.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "To switch to ORC:\n```python\n# ... other code\nS3bucket_node3 = glueContext.write_dynamic_frame.from_options(\n    frame=azureAuditLog_df_dynf,\n    connection_type=\"s3\",\n    format = \"orc\",\n    format_options = {\"compression\":\"snappy\"}, # or zstd for better compression\n    connection_options = {\"path\": S3bucket_node3_path, \"partitionKeys\": []},\n    transformation_ctx=\"S3bucket_node3\",\n)\n# ... rest of the code\n```\nConsider adding appropriate partitioning to the S3 path based on frequently queried columns (e.g., date, region) for better query performance.",
      "benefits": "Potentially better compression (depending on data) than gzip-compressed Parquet, faster reads/writes, and improved query performance through better data organization and partitioning."
