            "improvementExplanation": "Reading text files using `textFile()` is inefficient for structured data like logs. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance due to columnar storage and compression.",

            "improvementExplanation": "Using `repartition()` increases the number of partitions, potentially leading to unnecessary data shuffling. `coalesce()` should be used instead to reduce the number of partitions, improving performance.",
