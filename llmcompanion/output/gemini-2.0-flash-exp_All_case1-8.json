            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition(24)` operation forces a full shuffle of the data, which can be expensive. Since the goal is to reduce the number of partitions, `coalesce(24)` can be used instead if the number of partitions is less than the current number of partitions. If the number of partitions is greater than the current number of partitions, then repartition is required.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "airbnb_df.coalesce(24)",
            "benefits": "Using `coalesce()` avoids a full shuffle, potentially reducing network traffic and improving performance. It's more efficient when reducing the number of partitions."
