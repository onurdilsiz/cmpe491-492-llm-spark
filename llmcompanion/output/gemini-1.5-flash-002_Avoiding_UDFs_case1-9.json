            "improvementExplanation": "The UDF `splitPaths` splits a path string into an array of strings. This can be achieved using Spark's built-in functions without requiring a UDF.  The `split` function can be used to split the string at each '/', and then the `explode` function can be used to create a new row for each element in the resulting array.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "explodedPaths = csvDF.withColumn(\"PathParts\", explode(split(col(\"Path\"), \"/\")))",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with built-in functions allows Spark's Catalyst optimizer to perform more efficient query planning and execution.  This can lead to significant performance improvements, reduced serialization overhead, and better resource utilization.  Avoiding UDFs generally results in more efficient code that leverages Spark's optimized execution engine."
