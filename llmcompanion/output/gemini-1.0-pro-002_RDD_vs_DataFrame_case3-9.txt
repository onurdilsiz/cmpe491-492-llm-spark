      "rddOperation": "map",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `map` operation is used to apply a function to each element of an RDD. This can be inefficient for large datasets, as it requires shuffling the data across multiple partitions. DataFrames/Datasets offer optimized functions like `apply` and `transform` that can perform the same operation more efficiently without shuffling.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\n# Replace the RDD map operation with a DataFrame apply\nfeatures_pd = features_pd.apply(lambda row: row.map(lambda x: x * 2), axis=1)\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to DataFrame/Dataset for this operation can significantly improve performance by reducing shuffling and utilizing optimized functions."
