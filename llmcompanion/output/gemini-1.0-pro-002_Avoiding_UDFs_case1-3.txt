**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of User-Defined Functions (UDFs). All data transformations are performed using Spark SQL functions and native DataFrame/Dataset operations.

**Benefits of Avoiding UDFs:**

* **Catalyst Optimizations:** Spark SQL's Catalyst optimizer can effectively optimize queries that use built-in functions and native operations. UDFs, on the other hand, can hinder optimization due to their black-box nature.
* **Performance Improvement:** Built-in functions and native operations are generally more performant than UDFs, as they are implemented in Scala or Java and can leverage Spark's internal execution engine.
* **Reduced Serialization Overhead:** UDFs require serialization and deserialization between the driver and executors, which can introduce overhead. Avoiding UDFs can minimize this overhead.

**Conclusion:**

The provided Spark code effectively utilizes Spark SQL functions and native DataFrame/Dataset operations, resulting in optimized and performant data transformations.
