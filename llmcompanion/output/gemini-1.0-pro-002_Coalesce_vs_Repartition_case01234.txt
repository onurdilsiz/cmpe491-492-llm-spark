    {
      "operation": "df.repartition(10)  # Inefficient repartitioning",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation in this case is unnecessary and can be replaced with `coalesce()` because it does not involve a full shuffle. `repartition()` is used to increase the number of partitions, while `coalesce()` is used to decrease the number of partitions. Since we are not increasing the number of partitions, `coalesce()` is a more efficient choice.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "df.coalesce(10)",
      "benefits": "Replacing `repartition()` with `coalesce()` in this case will reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and potentially lead to a faster job runtime."
