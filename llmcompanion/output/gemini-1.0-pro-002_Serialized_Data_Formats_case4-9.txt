      "location": "Line 24: df.show(truncate=False)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a DataFrame, which is an in-memory representation. This can be inefficient for large datasets, as it requires loading the entire dataset into memory. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC would allow for more efficient data storage and retrieval, as the data would be stored in a compressed and columnar format.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read data from Parquet file\ndf = spark.read.parquet(\"path/to/parquet/file\")\n\n# Show data\ndf.show(truncate=False)\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC would provide the following benefits:\n* **Faster reads/writes:** Serialized formats like Parquet and ORC are optimized for efficient data storage and retrieval, resulting in faster read and write operations.\n* **Compression:** These formats compress data, reducing storage space requirements and improving network transfer speeds.\n* **Query optimization:** Parquet and ORC support predicate pushdown, which allows filtering data at the file level, further improving query performance."
