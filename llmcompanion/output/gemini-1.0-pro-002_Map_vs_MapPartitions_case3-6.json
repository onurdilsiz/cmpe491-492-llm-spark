            "operation": "map() operation on customerDF with lambda function at line 44",
            "improvementExplanation": "The map() operation at line 44 applies a lambda function to each row of the customerDF DataFrame. This function doubles the value of the 'salary' column. This operation can be performed more efficiently using mapPartitions() because it allows processing data in batches, reducing the overhead of function calls and potentially improving I/O efficiency.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\ncustomerDF = customerDF.mapPartitions(lambda partition: map(lambda row: row.asDict() | {'doublesalary': row['salary'] * 2}, partition))\n```",
            "benefits": "Replacing map() with mapPartitions() in this case can provide the following benefits:\n\n* **Reduced function call overhead:** mapPartitions() processes data in batches, reducing the number of function calls compared to map(). This can significantly improve performance, especially for large datasets.\n* **Optimized I/O:** mapPartitions() can potentially optimize I/O operations by reading and writing data in larger chunks. This can be beneficial for datasets stored in distributed file systems.\n* **Improved resource utilization:** mapPartitions() can improve resource utilization by reducing the number of threads or processes required to process the data. This can be especially beneficial for resource-constrained environments."
