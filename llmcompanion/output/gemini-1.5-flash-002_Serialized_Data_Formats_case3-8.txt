      "improvementExplanation": "The code currently writes the trained RBM weights to a CSV file. CSV is a text-based format, which is inefficient for storing numerical data like the weights.  Switching to a columnar, serialized format like Parquet or ORC significantly improves performance, especially for large datasets. Parquet and ORC offer better compression, faster read/write speeds, and support for predicate pushdown, enabling faster query processing if the data were to be used in subsequent Spark operations.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"RBM\").getOrCreate()\nweights_df = spark.createDataFrame(pd.DataFrame(result))\nweights_df.write.parquet(\"rbmWeights.parquet\")",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet offers several benefits:\n- **Faster read/write speeds:** Parquet's columnar storage and efficient encoding lead to significantly faster data loading and writing compared to CSV.\n- **Improved compression:** Parquet provides better compression ratios than CSV, reducing storage space and network transfer times.\n- **Predicate pushdown:** If the weights are used in further Spark SQL queries, Parquet's support for predicate pushdown allows Spark to filter data at the storage level, resulting in faster query execution."
