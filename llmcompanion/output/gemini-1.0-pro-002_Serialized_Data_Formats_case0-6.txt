      "operation": "Reading data from a list of strings (line 10)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current data format is a list of strings, which is not optimized for Spark processing. Reading data from a serialized format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve performance due to faster reads, compression, and query optimization through predicate pushdown.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read data from a Parquet file\nparquet_data = spark.read.parquet(\"path/to/parquet/file\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC would provide the following benefits:\n* Faster reads/writes\n* Compression\n* Query optimization through predicate pushdown"

      "operation": "Writing data to the console (lines 13 and 18)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Writing data to the console is not an efficient way to analyze data in Spark. Instead, the data should be written to a file in a serialized format like Parquet or ORC for further processing and analysis.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Write data to a Parquet file\nparquet_data.write.parquet(\"path/to/output/parquet/file\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Writing data to Parquet or ORC would provide the following benefits:\n* Efficient storage for large datasets\n* Support for complex data types\n* Compatibility with other Spark tools and libraries"
