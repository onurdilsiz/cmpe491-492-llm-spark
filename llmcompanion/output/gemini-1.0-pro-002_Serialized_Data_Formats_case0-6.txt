**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any explicit input/output operations. It only performs in-memory transformations on an RDD using `flatMap` and `collect`. Therefore, there are no opportunities to optimize data formats for faster reads/writes or compression. 

The code snippet demonstrates basic RDD operations:

1. **Line 1-3:** Imports necessary libraries and creates a SparkSession.
2. **Line 5-9:** Defines a list of strings and creates an RDD from it.
3. **Line 11-13:** Iterates through the RDD and prints each element.
4. **Line 15-17:** Applies `flatMap` to split each string into words and creates a new RDD.
5. **Line 19-21:** Iterates through the new RDD and prints each word.

While the code doesn't involve input/output operations, it's important to note that if this code were to read data from external sources or write data to external files, optimizing the data format (e.g., using Parquet or ORC) could significantly improve performance.
