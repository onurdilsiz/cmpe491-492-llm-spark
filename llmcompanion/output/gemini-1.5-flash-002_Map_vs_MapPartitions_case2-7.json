            "improvementExplanation": "This map operation converts each line (string) in the text file to a list of floats. This operation can be performed on a per-partition basis.  Processing an entire partition at once reduces the overhead of repeatedly calling the lambda function for each individual line.  The I/O operations involved in reading the partition are also optimized.",

            "improvementExplanation": "This map operation performs matrix multiplication of each row in RDD 'A' with the matrix 'AT_A'.  This is a computationally intensive operation that can benefit from being performed on a per-partition basis.  Processing multiple rows within a partition reduces the overhead of repeatedly transferring data between the driver and executors.",
