            "operation": "The map() operation is used on line 34 to apply the `delta_mol` function to each element of the `array_col` column.",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `delta_mol` function calculates the percentage change between consecutive elements in an array. This operation is well-suited for parallelization at the partition level because it can be applied independently to each partition without requiring data shuffling. By using `mapPartitions`, we can avoid the overhead of calling the function for each individual element and instead process the data in batches within each partition.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\n@udf(ArrayType(DoubleType()))\ndef delta_mol_partition(iterator):\n    for array in iterator:\n        differenze = [(array[i+1] / array[i] -1)*100 if array[i] != 0.0 else 0.0 for i in range(len(array)-1) ]\n        yield differenze\n\ndff = df.withColumn('delta_arry', F.expr('transform(array_col, delta_mol_partition)'))\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to `mapPartitions` in this case offers several benefits:\n\n* **Reduced function call overhead:** By processing data in batches, we can significantly reduce the number of function calls, leading to improved performance.\n* **Optimized I/O:** `mapPartitions` allows for more efficient data access patterns, reducing the need for data shuffling and improving I/O performance.\n* **Improved resource utilization:** By processing data in parallel within partitions, we can better utilize available resources and achieve faster execution times."
