            "improvementExplanation": "The code currently reads employee data from a plain text file (`employees.txt`). This is inefficient because text files are not optimized for data processing. Each line needs to be parsed, which is computationally expensive. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve performance. Parquet is a good choice for this scenario because it is widely supported, provides efficient compression, and allows for predicate pushdown, which can reduce the amount of data read from disk.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\n# Initialize Spark session\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"OptimizedExample\").master(\"local[*]\").getOrCreate()\n\n# Assuming the data is now in Parquet format\nemployee_df = spark.read.parquet(\"path/to/employees.parquet\")\n\n# Filtering for high salaries using DataFrame API\nhigh_salary_df = employee_df.filter(employee_df[\"salary\"] > 50000)\nhigh_salary_count = high_salary_df.count()\nprint(f\"Number of employees with high salary: {high_salary_count}\")\n\n# Applying a transformation to calculate bonuses for high-salary employees\nbonus_df = high_salary_df.withColumn(\"bonus\", high_salary_df[\"salary\"] * 1.1)\nprint(\"Sample employees with bonuses:\", bonus_df.take(5))\n\n# Stop Spark session\nspark.stop()\n```\n",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet offers several benefits:\n1. **Faster Reads:** Parquet is a columnar format, which means that only the necessary columns are read from disk, reducing I/O overhead.\n2. **Compression:** Parquet files are typically compressed, which reduces storage space and further improves read performance.\n3. **Predicate Pushdown:** Spark can push down filters to the data source, meaning that only the relevant data is read into memory, reducing processing time.\n4. **Schema Awareness:** Parquet files store schema information, which allows Spark to optimize data access and processing.\n5. **Type Safety:** Using DataFrames with Parquet provides type safety and allows for more efficient query planning."
