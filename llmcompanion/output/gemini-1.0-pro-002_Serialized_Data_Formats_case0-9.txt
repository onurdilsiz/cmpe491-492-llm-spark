      "operation": "Reading data from a text file using `textFile` on line 7.",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current code reads data from a text file, which is not an optimized format for Spark. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve performance due to faster reads/writes, compression, and query optimization through predicate pushdown.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read data from a Parquet file\nparquet_df = spark.read.parquet(\"/path/to/data.parquet\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC will provide the following benefits:\n* **Faster reads/writes:** Serialized formats like Parquet and ORC are optimized for reading and writing data in Spark, resulting in faster processing times.\n* **Compression:** These formats compress data efficiently, reducing storage space and network transfer times.\n* **Query optimization:** Parquet and ORC support predicate pushdown, which allows Spark to filter data before reading it, further improving query performance."
