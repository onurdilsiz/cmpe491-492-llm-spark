      "operation": "Downloading NETCDF file into local bucket (line 34)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Downloading the NETCDF file into the local bucket before processing it can be inefficient, especially when dealing with large datasets. Instead, you can directly read the NETCDF file from S3 using the `spark.read.format('netcdf')` function. This avoids unnecessary data transfer and improves processing speed.",
