This can be inefficient because it involves creating a new array for each line. mapPartitions() can be used to process the data in batches, which can reduce the number of function calls and improve performance.",

This can be inefficient because it involves creating a new tuple for each record. mapPartitions() can be used to process the data in batches, which can reduce the number of function calls and improve performance.",
