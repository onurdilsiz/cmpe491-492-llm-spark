```json
{
  "detected": false,
  "occurrences": 0,
  "response": []
}
```

**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of User-Defined Functions (UDFs). Therefore, the "detected" field is set to "false," and the "occurrences" field is set to 0. Consequently, the "response" array is empty.

**Analysis:**

The code demonstrates the use of RDDs and DataFrames/Datasets for data processing. However, it includes some inefficient practices that could be improved:

- **Using RDDs instead of DataFrames/Datasets:** The code initially uses RDDs to read and parse the sales data. This approach is less efficient than using DataFrames/Datasets, which provide higher-level abstractions and optimized operations.
- **Using `repartition()` instead of `coalesce()`:** The code uses `repartition()` to increase the number of partitions before writing to an output. However, `coalesce()` would be more appropriate in this case, as it reduces the number of partitions without shuffling data across nodes.

**Recommendations:**

- Convert the RDD to a DataFrame/Dataset as early as possible to leverage Spark's optimized operations.
- Use `coalesce()` instead of `repartition()` when reducing the number of partitions to avoid unnecessary data shuffling.

By following these recommendations, the code can be made more efficient and perform better.
