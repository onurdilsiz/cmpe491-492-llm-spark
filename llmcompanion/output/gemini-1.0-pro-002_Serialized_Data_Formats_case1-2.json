            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads a CSV file from HDFS, which is a text-based format. This can be inefficient for large datasets due to the overhead of parsing and processing text data. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed and enabling columnar storage.",

            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC would provide the following benefits:\n- Faster reads/writes: Serialized formats like Parquet and ORC are optimized for efficient data storage and retrieval, resulting in faster read and write operations.\n- Compression: Parquet and ORC support compression, which can significantly reduce the storage space required for the data.\n- Query optimization: Parquet and ORC enable columnar storage, which allows Spark to only read the columns that are needed for a query, further improving performance."
