            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads a XML file.  XML is not a columnar storage format and lacks efficient compression.  Switching to Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance and reduce storage space.  Parquet and ORC offer columnar storage, enabling efficient processing of only the required columns, and support compression algorithms like Snappy or Zstandard.",

            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads a text file containing stop words. While this file is likely small, using a serialized format like Parquet would still offer benefits in terms of consistent data handling within the Spark ecosystem.  Parquet's schema enforcement can also help prevent data inconsistencies.",
