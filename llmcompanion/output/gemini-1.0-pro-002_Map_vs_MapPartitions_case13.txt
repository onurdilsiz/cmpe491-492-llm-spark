      "operation": "Filtering data based on category using map() (line 13)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The filtering operation in line 13 can be performed more efficiently using mapPartitions() instead of map(). This is because mapPartitions() processes data in partitions, reducing the number of function calls and improving I/O efficiency. In this case, the filtering operation can be done within each partition, avoiding unnecessary data shuffling across partitions.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\nelectronics_df = repartitioned_df.mapPartitions(lambda partition: filter(lambda row: row['category'] == 'Electronics', partition))\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() in this case offers several benefits:\n- **Reduced function call overhead:** By processing data in partitions, mapPartitions() avoids the overhead of calling the filtering function for each individual row.\n- **Optimized I/O:** Data is processed within partitions, minimizing data shuffling across the network.\n- **Improved resource utilization:** By reducing the number of function calls and data shuffling, mapPartitions() can improve resource utilization and overall performance."
