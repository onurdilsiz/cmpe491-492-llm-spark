These can be replaced with DataFrame/Dataset operations for better performance and optimization. The `mapPartitionsWithIndex` can be converted to a `mapPartitions` operation on a DataFrame after converting the input RDD to a DataFrame. The `reduceByKey` can be replaced with a `groupBy` and `agg` operation on the DataFrame.",
