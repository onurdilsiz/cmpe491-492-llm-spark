      "improvementExplanation": "The UDF `new_salary` simply adds two columns. This can be directly replaced with the built-in `+` operator in Spark.",

      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the previous case, the `new_salary` UDF performs a simple addition. This can be replaced with the `+` operator within a `select` statement or directly in the SQL query.",
