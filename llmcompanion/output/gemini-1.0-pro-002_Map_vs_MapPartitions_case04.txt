    {
      "operation": "parsed_customer_rdd = customer_rdd.map(lambda line: line.split(\",\"))",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current map() operation splits each line of the text file into a list of values. This involves iterating over each line individually, which can be inefficient for large datasets. By using mapPartitions(), we can process multiple lines at once, reducing the number of function calls and improving performance.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "parsed_customer_rdd = customer_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: (line.split(\",\") for line in partition))",
      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() offers several benefits:\n- Reduced function call overhead: Instead of calling the split() function for each line, we process multiple lines at once, reducing the number of function calls.\n- Optimized I/O: Reading and processing data in larger chunks can improve I/O efficiency.\n- Improved resource utilization: By processing data in parallel across multiple partitions, we can utilize resources more effectively."
