      "improvementExplanation": "This map() operation is used to convert transaction amounts from string to float. This transformation can be performed more efficiently at the partition level using mapPartitions() because it avoids the overhead of creating a new RDD for each element. Additionally, mapPartitions() can optimize I/O by reading and processing data in batches.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "amounts_rdd = usd_transactions_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: (float(txn[1]) for txn in partition))",
      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() in this case will reduce function call overhead, optimize I/O, and improve performance for partition-level operations."
