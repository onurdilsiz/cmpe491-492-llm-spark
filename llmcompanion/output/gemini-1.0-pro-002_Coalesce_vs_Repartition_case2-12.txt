    {
      "operation": "sqldf = sqldf.repartition(partitions)",
      "improvementExplanation": "This repartition() operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame. However, since the subsequent operation is coalesce(), which reduces the number of partitions, it is more efficient to use coalesce() directly to achieve the desired number of partitions without the unnecessary shuffle caused by repartition().",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "sqldf = sqldf.coalesce(partitions)",
      "benefits": "Replacing repartition() with coalesce() in this case will reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and potentially lead to faster job runtime."
