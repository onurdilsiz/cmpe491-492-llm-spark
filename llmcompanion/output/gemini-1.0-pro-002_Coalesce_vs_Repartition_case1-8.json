            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame from its original number to 24. However, in this case, the `randomSplit()` operation will shuffle the data anyway, regardless of the number of partitions. Therefore, using `coalesce()` instead of `repartition()` would be more efficient as it would avoid unnecessary shuffling and potentially improve the job runtime.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "train_coalesce_df, val_coalesce_df, test_coalesce_df = (airbnb_df\n                                             .coalesce(24)\n                                             .randomSplit([.7, .15, .15], seed=42))",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` in this case would provide the following benefits:\n\n* **Reduced shuffling:** `coalesce()` only redistributes data within existing partitions, while `repartition()` shuffles the entire dataset. This can significantly reduce the amount of data transferred across the network, leading to faster job execution.\n* **Improved resource usage:** `coalesce()` requires less memory and CPU resources compared to `repartition()`, as it avoids the overhead of shuffling the entire dataset.\n* **Faster runtime:** By reducing shuffling and resource usage, `coalesce()` can potentially improve the overall runtime of the job."
