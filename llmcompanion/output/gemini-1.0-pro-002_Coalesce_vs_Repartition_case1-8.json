            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation on line 24 is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame. However, since we are only splitting the data into train, validation, and test sets, a full shuffle is not required. We can achieve the same result with `coalesce()`, which reduces the number of partitions without shuffling the data. This will improve efficiency by reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred across the network.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "train_repartition_df, val_repartition_df, test_repartition_df = (airbnb_df\n                                             .coalesce(24)\n                                             .randomSplit([.7, .15, .15], seed=42))",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` in this case will provide the following benefits:\n* **Reduced shuffling:** By avoiding a full shuffle, we can significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred across the network, leading to faster job execution.\n* **Improved resource usage:** Reducing the number of partitions can free up resources on the cluster, allowing other jobs to run more efficiently.\n* **Faster runtime:** Overall, using `coalesce()` instead of `repartition()` can lead to a faster job runtime."
