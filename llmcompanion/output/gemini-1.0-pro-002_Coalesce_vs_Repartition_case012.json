            "operation": "usd_transactions_df.repartition(10)  # Inefficiently increasing partitions",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame. However, in this case, we only want to reduce the number of partitions for writing. Using `coalesce()` instead would achieve the same goal without performing a full shuffle, which can be computationally expensive.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "usd_transactions_df.coalesce(10)",
            "benefits": "Replacing `repartition()` with `coalesce()` in this case would:\n- Reduce shuffling, leading to faster job execution.\n- Improve resource utilization by avoiding unnecessary data movement.\n- Potentially reduce the overall runtime of the job."
