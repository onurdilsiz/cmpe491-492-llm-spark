            "improvementExplanation": "While the code uses `toDF` to convert the result of `csv` to a DataFrame, the underlying reading of the CSV file is still done using RDDs.  This can be improved by directly reading the data into a DataFrame using Spark's optimized CSV reader.",

            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition(1)` operation is used before writing to Parquet. Since the goal is to write to a single partition, `coalesce` is more efficient as it avoids unnecessary shuffling.  `repartition` always performs a full shuffle, regardless of the number of partitions.",
