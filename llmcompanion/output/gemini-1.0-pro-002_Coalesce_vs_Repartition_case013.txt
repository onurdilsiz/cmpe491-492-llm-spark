    {
      "operation": "repartitioned_df = filtered_transactions_df.repartition(10)  # Inefficient partitioning",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame. However, in this case, the DataFrame is already filtered for transactions in the 'Electronics' category, which likely reduces the number of rows significantly. Using `coalesce()` instead would avoid a full shuffle and potentially improve performance.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "coalesced_df = filtered_transactions_df.coalesce(10)  # Efficient partitioning",
      "benefits": "Replacing `repartition()` with `coalesce()` in this case would:\n- Avoid a full shuffle, reducing data movement and improving performance.\n- Potentially reduce resource usage by avoiding unnecessary data duplication.\n- Potentially lead to a faster job runtime."
