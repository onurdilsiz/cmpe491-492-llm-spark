    {
      "rddOperation": "textFile and collect (lines 7-8, 9-10)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Reading a text file into an RDD using `textFile` and then collecting it to the driver using `collect` is inefficient for large files.  It brings the entire dataset into the driver's memory, which can lead to out-of-memory errors and slow processing. DataFrames provide optimized file reading and distributed processing.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName('SparkByExamples.com').getOrCreate()\ndf = spark.read.text(\"/apps/sparkbyexamples/src/pyspark-examples/data.txt\")\ndf.show()\n```",
      "benefits": "Improved scalability and efficiency by avoiding data transfer to the driver.  DataFrames handle large datasets more effectively through distributed processing."
    },
    {
      "rddOperation": "flatMap (line 13)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `flatMap` operation on an RDD is less efficient than the equivalent `explode` function in DataFrames. DataFrames offer optimized execution plans and better performance for this type of transformation.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import explode, split\ndf2 = df.withColumn(\"words\", explode(split(df[\"value\"], \" \")))\ndf2.show()\n```",
      "benefits": "Optimized execution plan and potentially reduced shuffling compared to RDD's `flatMap`."
    },
    {
      "rddOperation": "map (line 16)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to `flatMap`, the RDD `map` operation can be replaced with a DataFrame transformation for better performance and optimization.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import lit\ndf3 = df2.withColumn(\"count\", lit(1))\ndf3.show()\n```",
      "benefits": "Leverages DataFrame's optimized execution engine for improved performance."
    },
    {
      "rddOperation": "reduceByKey (line 20)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `reduceByKey` operation on RDDs involves significant data shuffling. DataFrames provide optimized aggregation functions like `groupBy` and `agg` that minimize shuffling and improve performance.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\ndf4 = df3.groupBy(\"words\").agg(sum(\"count\").alias(\"sum\"))\ndf4.show()\n```",
      "benefits": "Reduced data shuffling and improved performance through optimized aggregation."
    },
    {
      "rddOperation": "map and sortByKey (line 24)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The combination of `map` and `sortByKey` on RDDs can be replaced with DataFrame's `orderBy` for better performance and readability.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\ndf5 = df4.selectExpr(\"sum\", \"words\").orderBy(\"sum\")\ndf5.show()\n```",
      "benefits": "Improved performance and readability through DataFrame's built-in sorting capabilities."
    },
    {
      "rddOperation": "filter (line 28)",
      "improvementExplanation": "RDD's `filter` operation can be replaced with DataFrame's `filter` or `where` for better performance and integration with other DataFrame operations.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\ndf6 = df5.filter(df5[\"words\"].contains(\"a\"))\ndf6.show()\n```",
      "benefits": "Improved performance and integration with other DataFrame operations."
