**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of `map()` transformations. Therefore, there are no opportunities to replace them with `mapPartitions()` for improved efficiency.

**Additional Notes:**

* The code snippet provided focuses on data loading, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. It does not involve any data transformations using `map()` or `mapPartitions()`.
* While `mapPartitions()` can offer performance benefits in certain scenarios, it's important to carefully evaluate its suitability based on the specific data processing requirements and the nature of the transformations involved.
