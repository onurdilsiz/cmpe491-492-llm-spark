      "operation": "The map() operation is used on line 34 to apply the eval_metrics function to each element of the predicted_qualities array.",
      "improvementExplanation": "The eval_metrics function is a relatively complex operation that involves multiple calculations. By using mapPartitions() instead of map(), we can perform these calculations on a per-partition basis, which can significantly improve performance, especially for large datasets. Additionally, mapPartitions() can reduce the number of function calls, which can further improve efficiency.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\nrmse, mae, r2 = predicted_qualities.rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: (eval_metrics(partition[1], partition[0]))).collect()\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() in this case can provide the following benefits:\n\n* **Reduced function call overhead:** By performing the calculations on a per-partition basis, we can avoid the overhead of calling the eval_metrics function for each individual element.\n* **Optimized I/O:** mapPartitions() can potentially reduce the amount of data that needs to be shuffled between partitions, which can improve I/O performance.\n* **Improved resource utilization:** By processing data in larger chunks, mapPartitions() can make more efficient use of available resources."
