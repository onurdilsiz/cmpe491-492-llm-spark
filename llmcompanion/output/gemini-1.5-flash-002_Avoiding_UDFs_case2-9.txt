      "operation": "pointToCell function (lines 21-29)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `pointToCell` UDF calculates the cell index for each point. This can be replaced with a native Spark transformation using `withColumn` and built-in functions like `floor`.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "inputPoints.withColumn(\"cell_x\", floor(col(\"_1\") / omega)).withColumn(\"cell_y\", floor(col(\"_2\") / omega)).withColumn(\"cell\", struct(col(\"cell_x\"), col(\"cell_y\"))).groupBy(\"cell\").count()",
      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with built-in functions allows Spark's optimizer to leverage Catalyst optimizations, potentially leading to significant performance improvements by eliminating the overhead of UDF serialization and execution."

      "operation": "region_counts7 function (lines 42-53)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `region_counts7` UDF calculates the total count within a 7x7 region. This can be optimized using Spark's window functions or by joining the `cells_counts` DataFrame with itself multiple times.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "A more efficient approach would involve creating a grid of cells and using joins or window functions to count points within the 7x7 region.  This would require restructuring the data and is more complex than a simple UDF replacement.  A detailed solution would require significant code restructuring.",
      "benefits": "Replacing this UDF with a more optimized approach using Spark's built-in functions would improve performance by leveraging Spark's parallel processing capabilities and avoiding the overhead of UDF execution."

    {
      "operation": "region_counts3 function (lines 55-66)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to `region_counts7`, `region_counts3` calculates counts within a 3x3 region.  This can also be optimized using Spark's window functions or self-joins, avoiding the UDF.",
