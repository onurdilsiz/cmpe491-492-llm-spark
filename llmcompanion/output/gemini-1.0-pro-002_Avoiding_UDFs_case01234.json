            "improvementExplanation": "The UDF `multiply_by_two` can be replaced with the built-in Spark SQL function `multiply(col('numbers'), 2)`. This avoids the overhead of creating and registering a UDF, and allows Catalyst optimizations to be applied.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "```python\nresult_with_udf = df.withColumn('doubled', multiply(col('numbers'), 2))\n```",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with a built-in function provides the following benefits:\n- Enables Catalyst optimizations for improved query performance.\n- Reduces serialization overhead by avoiding the need to transfer UDF code across executors.\n- Improves code readability and maintainability."
