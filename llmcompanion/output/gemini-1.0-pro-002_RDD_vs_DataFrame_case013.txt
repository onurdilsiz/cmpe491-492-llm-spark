      "rddOperation": "map",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `map` operation is used to parse the RDD into a structured format. This can be done more efficiently using the DataFrame/Dataset API's built-in parsing capabilities.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\n# Read the text file directly into a DataFrame\nfiltered_transactions_df = spark.read.text(\"path/to/transactions.txt\").option(\"delimiter\", \",\").option(\"header\", False).toDF(\"transaction_id\", \"customer_id\", \"amount\", \"category\")\n```",
      "benefits": "This approach avoids the overhead of creating an RDD and then converting it to a DataFrame. It also allows for query optimizations and reduced shuffling."

      "improvementExplanation": "The `filter` operation is used to select transactions with the category \"Electronics\". This can be done more efficiently using the DataFrame/Dataset API's `filter` method.",
