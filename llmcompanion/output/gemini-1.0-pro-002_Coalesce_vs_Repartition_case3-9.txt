      "operation": "repartition(100)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition(100)` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame. However, since the subsequent operation is `coalesce(10)`, which reduces the number of partitions to 10, it is more efficient to use `coalesce(10)` directly. This will avoid the unnecessary shuffle caused by `repartition(100)`. Replacing `repartition(100)` with `coalesce(10)` will reduce the amount of data shuffled, improve resource utilization, and potentially speed up the job execution.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "df = df.coalesce(10)",
      "benefits": "Reduced shuffling, improved resource usage, and faster job runtime."
