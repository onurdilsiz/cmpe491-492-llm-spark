    {
      "operation": "movie_rating_counts.repartition(10)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions to 10. However, since we are only sorting the data by key, a full shuffle is not required. We can achieve the same result with `coalesce()` which only reduces the number of partitions without shuffling the data.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "movie_rating_counts.coalesce(10)",
      "benefits": "Replacing `repartition()` with `coalesce()` will avoid unnecessary shuffling, leading to improved resource usage and faster job runtime."
