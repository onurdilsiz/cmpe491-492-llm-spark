**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any explicit input/output operations. While it does perform data transformations and aggregations, these operations are done in-memory using Spark's distributed computing framework. Therefore, there are no opportunities to optimize data formats for faster reads/writes or compression.

**Additional Notes:**

* The code uses `parallelize` to create RDDs from Python lists. This is an in-memory operation and does not involve reading data from external sources.
* The `collect` action is used to gather data from the RDD into a Python list. This is also an in-memory operation and does not involve writing data to external storage.
* The code demonstrates various aggregation and reduction operations on the RDDs. These operations are performed in-memory and do not involve reading or writing data from external sources.

**Conclusion:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any input/output operations that can be optimized by switching to serialized data formats like Parquet or ORC. The code primarily focuses on in-memory data transformations and aggregations.
