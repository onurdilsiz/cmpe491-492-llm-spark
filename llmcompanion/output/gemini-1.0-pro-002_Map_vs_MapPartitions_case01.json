            "improvementExplanation": "The current map() operation splits each line of the text file into a list of values. This involves iterating over each line individually, which can be inefficient for large datasets. By using mapPartitions(), we can process multiple lines at once, reducing the number of function calls and improving performance.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "parsed_sales_rdd = sales_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: (line.split(\",\") for line in partition))",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() offers several benefits:\n- Reduced function call overhead: Instead of calling the splitting function for each line, we call it once for each partition, reducing the number of function calls.\n- Optimized I/O: Processing multiple lines at once can improve I/O efficiency, especially when reading from or writing to external storage.\n- Improved resource utilization: By processing data in larger chunks, we can better utilize available resources, such as CPU and memory."
