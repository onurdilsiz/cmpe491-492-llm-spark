            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to change the number of partitions of the RDD to `self.num_workers`. Since the goal is to reduce the number of partitions to match the number of workers, and not to increase it, `coalesce()` can be used instead. `coalesce()` avoids a full shuffle if the number of target partitions is less than the current number of partitions, which is likely the case here. `repartition()` always triggers a full shuffle, which is more expensive.",

            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` will reduce shuffling, potentially improving resource usage and leading to faster job runtime. If the number of partitions before this operation is greater than `self.num_workers`, `coalesce()` will avoid a full shuffle, which is more efficient."
