            "improvementExplanation": "The code uses `repartition(10)` to redistribute the data into 10 partitions.  This operation triggers a full shuffle, regardless of the initial number of partitions. Since the goal is likely not to increase the number of partitions but potentially to adjust it for downstream operations or output, using `coalesce` would be more efficient if the number of partitions is already greater than or equal to 10. If the initial number of partitions is less than 10, `coalesce` will still be more efficient than `repartition` as it avoids a full shuffle.  `coalesce` only moves data within the existing partitions, reducing the overhead.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "repartitioned_df = filtered_transactions_df.coalesce(10)",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce(10)` offers significant performance improvements. It avoids a full data shuffle, leading to reduced network traffic, lower CPU usage, and faster job completion.  Resource utilization is improved as less time is spent on data movement. The overall runtime of the job will be considerably faster, especially for large datasets."
