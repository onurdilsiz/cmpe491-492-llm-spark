      "improvementExplanation": "The code uses `repartition(1)` before writing the DataFrame to a CSV file. The purpose is to force the output to be written into a single file. Since the goal is to reduce the number of partitions to 1, `coalesce(1)` can be used instead of `repartition(1)`. `repartition()` always performs a full shuffle, while `coalesce()` can avoid a full shuffle when reducing the number of partitions. In this case, since we are reducing the number of partitions, `coalesce()` is more efficient.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "df2.coalesce(1).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/repartition/1\")",
      "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce(1)` will avoid a full shuffle, which is performed by `repartition(1)`. This will result in reduced data movement across the network, leading to improved resource usage (less CPU and network I/O) and faster job runtime. The output will still be a single file as required."
