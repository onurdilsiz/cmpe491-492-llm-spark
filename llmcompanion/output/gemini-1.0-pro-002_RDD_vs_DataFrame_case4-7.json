            "improvementExplanation": "The ApplyMapping operation involves iterating through each element of the RDD, which can be inefficient for large datasets. DataFrame/Dataset provides a more optimized way to perform transformations using SQL-like syntax, which can significantly improve performance.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\n# Convert the RDD to a DataFrame\nApplyMapping_df = ApplyMapping_node2.toDF()\n\n# Perform the transformations using DataFrame API\nApplyMapping_df = ApplyMapping_df.withColumn(\"time\", MAP_TIME(col('time')).cast('integer'))\nApplyMapping_df = ApplyMapping_df.withColumn(\"severity_id\", MAP_SEVID(col('severity')).cast('integer'))\n# ... (other transformations)\n\n# Write the DataFrame to S3\nApplyMapping_df.write.parquet(S3bucket_node3_path, compression=\"gzip\")\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to DataFrame/Dataset for the ApplyMapping operation can provide the following benefits:\n\n* **Improved performance:** DataFrame/Dataset leverages Spark SQL's Catalyst Optimizer, which can generate more efficient execution plans compared to RDD operations.\n* **Reduced shuffling:** DataFrame/Dataset operations are often optimized to minimize data shuffling, which can significantly improve performance for large datasets.\n* **Better resource usage:** DataFrame/Dataset operations can be more memory-efficient than RDD operations, especially when dealing with complex transformations."
