      "improvementExplanation": "The `getMSDiff` function calculates the time difference in milliseconds. This can be achieved using Spark's built-in functions for time manipulation. Specifically, we can use the `total_seconds()` method of the `timedelta` object and multiply by 1000 to get milliseconds.",

      "operation": "tensorOps.getDim (ret) at line 218",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `tensorOps.getDim` function is used to extract tensor dimensions. Without knowing the implementation of `tensorOps.getDim`, it's hard to provide a direct replacement. However, if it's a simple aggregation or calculation on the list of dimensions, it can be replaced with Spark's built-in functions like `reduce` or `aggregate` after collecting the data. If it involves complex logic, it might be better to keep it as a UDF, but if it's simple, it can be replaced with native Spark operations.",
