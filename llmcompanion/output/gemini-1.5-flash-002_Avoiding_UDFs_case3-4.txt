    {
      "operation": "Line 163: convert_time_udf = udf(lambda time_str: convert_time(time_str), StringType())",
      "improvementExplanation": "The UDF `convert_time_udf` converts a time string from 12-hour format to 24-hour format. This can be achieved using built-in Spark SQL functions like `hour`, `substring`, and conditional logic within a `when` statement.  The current implementation involves a Python function which is executed on each row, leading to serialization overhead and hindering Spark's optimization capabilities.  A Spark SQL expression will allow Catalyst to optimize the execution plan.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "weather_df = weather_df.withColumn(\"time\", when(substring(col(\"time\"), -2) == \"PM\", hour(col(\"time\")) + 12, hour(col(\"time\"))).cast(StringType()).alias(\"time\"))",
      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with built-in functions enables Catalyst optimizations, leading to improved performance and reduced serialization overhead.  Spark can push down the computation to the executors, resulting in faster processing."
    },
    {
      "operation": "Line 164: split_udf = udf(lambda x: int(x.split(\" \")[0]), IntegerType())",
      "improvementExplanation": "The UDF `split_udf` extracts the integer part of a string by splitting it on a space and converting the first part to an integer. This can be replaced by using the `split` function followed by `get` to extract the first element and then casting to an integer type.  Similar to the previous UDF, this Python function is executed row-by-row, limiting Spark's optimization potential.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "weather_df = weather_df.withColumn(\"humidity\", col(\"humidity\").cast(StringType()).substr(1, length(col(\"humidity\")) - 3).cast(IntegerType()))",
      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with built-in functions enables Catalyst optimizations, leading to improved performance and reduced serialization overhead. Spark can push down the computation to the executors, resulting in faster processing."
