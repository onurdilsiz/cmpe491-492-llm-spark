            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the `rawData` RDD. However, since we are only reading the data from a file, there is no need to shuffle the data. Therefore, we can replace `repartition()` with `coalesce()` to simply increase the number of partitions without shuffling the data.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "rawData = sc.textFile(data_path).coalesce(numPartitions=L)",
            "benefits": "Replacing `repartition()` with `coalesce()` will avoid unnecessary shuffling, which can significantly improve the performance of the job. This is because shuffling data across the cluster can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive operation. By using `coalesce()`, we can reduce the amount of data that needs to be shuffled, leading to faster job execution times and improved resource utilization."
