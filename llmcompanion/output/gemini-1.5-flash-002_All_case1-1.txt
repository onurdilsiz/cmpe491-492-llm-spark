      "improvementExplanation": "The code uses repartition(50) before writing to CSV.  If the number of partitions after the transformations is already less than or equal to 50, repartition is unnecessary and causes a full shuffle.  coalesce can reduce the number of partitions without a full shuffle, improving performance.",
