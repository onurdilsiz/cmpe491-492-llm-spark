      "improvementExplanation": "The code uses repartition(50) before writing to CSV.  If the number of partitions after the transformations is already less than or equal to 50, repartition is unnecessary and causes a full shuffle.  coalesce can reduce the number of partitions without shuffling if the target number is less than or equal to the current number of partitions.

      "benefits": "Reduced shuffle time and improved resource utilization.  If the number of partitions is already less than 50, coalesce avoids unnecessary shuffling entirely."
