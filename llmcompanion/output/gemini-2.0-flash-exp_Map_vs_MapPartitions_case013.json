            "improvementExplanation": "The `map` operation is used to split each line of the input text file into a list of strings based on the comma delimiter. This operation is applied to each record individually. Since the splitting operation is independent for each line, it can be performed at the partition level using `mapPartitions`. This will reduce the overhead of calling the lambda function for each record and allow for potential optimizations if the splitting logic was more complex.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "parsed_transactions_rdd = transactions_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: [line.split(\",\") for line in partition])",
            "benefits": "Switching to `mapPartitions` reduces the function call overhead because the lambda function is called once per partition instead of once per record. This can lead to performance improvements, especially when dealing with large datasets and complex transformations. Additionally, if the splitting logic was more complex, `mapPartitions` would allow for more efficient resource utilization by processing records in batches."
