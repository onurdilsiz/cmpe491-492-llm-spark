**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of User-Defined Functions (UDFs). The code primarily focuses on downloading files from URLs and storing them in HDFS using the `urllib2` library and `subprocess.call`. 

Therefore, there are no UDFs to analyze or replace with Spark's built-in functions or native DataFrame/Dataset operations. 

The code could potentially be optimized by using Spark's built-in functions for file I/O operations, such as `spark.read.text` and `spark.write.text`, instead of relying on external libraries and system calls. However, this would require significant modifications to the existing code structure.
