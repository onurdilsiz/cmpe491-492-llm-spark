**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of User-Defined Functions (UDFs). The code primarily focuses on downloading files from a list of URLs and storing them in HDFS. The `download` function reads a text file containing URLs, repartitions it for parallel processing, and then iterates over each URL to download the corresponding file. The `getForm` function handles the actual download process, opening a connection to the URL, reading the file content, and writing it to a local file. Finally, the downloaded file is uploaded to HDFS using the `hadoop fs -put` command.

Since there are no UDFs present in the code, there are no occurrences to analyze or potential replacements to suggest. The code leverages Spark's built-in functions and DataFrame/Dataset operations for file handling and processing, which are generally preferred over UDFs due to their performance benefits and Catalyst optimization capabilities.
