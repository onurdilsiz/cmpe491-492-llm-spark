      "rddOperation": "electronics_sales_df.repartition(10) (line 20)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Using repartition() unnecessarily shuffles data across the cluster.  It's better to control partitioning during DataFrame creation or use coalesce() for reducing partitions.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "The repartition is unnecessary if the number of partitions is appropriate for the data size. If you need to reduce the number of partitions, use coalesce() instead of repartition().  For writing to a file, the number of partitions should be set appropriately during the write operation to avoid unnecessary shuffling.  For example:\nelectronics_sales_df.write.csv(\"output_path\", numPartitions=1)",
      "benefits": "Avoiding unnecessary repartitioning reduces data shuffling, improving performance and resource utilization. Using coalesce() for reducing partitions minimizes data movement."
