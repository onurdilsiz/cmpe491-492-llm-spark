      "improvementExplanation": "The current code reads data from a REST API using the `requests` library, which is not an optimized format for Spark. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve performance by reducing the need for parsing and deserialization during data processing.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read data from a Parquet file\nparquet_df = spark.read.parquet(\"path/to/parquet/file\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC would provide the following benefits:\n* **Faster reads/writes:** Parquet and ORC are columnar formats that allow for efficient data access and manipulation, resulting in faster read and write operations.\n* **Compression:** Parquet and ORC support compression, which reduces storage space requirements and improves data transfer speeds.\n* **Query optimization:** Parquet and ORC enable predicate pushdown, where filters are applied directly to the data files, further improving query performance."
