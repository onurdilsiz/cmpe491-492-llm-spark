      "operation": "Read from a REST API using the `requests` library (line 17)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current code uses the `requests` library to read data from a REST API in JSON format. This approach can be inefficient for large datasets, as it involves parsing and deserializing the JSON data for each record. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read data from a Parquet file\nparquet_df = spark.read.parquet(\"path/to/parquet/file\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC would provide the following benefits:\n* **Faster reads/writes:** Serialized formats like Parquet and ORC are optimized for efficient data storage and retrieval, resulting in faster read and write operations.\n* **Compression:** These formats compress data efficiently, reducing storage requirements and network transfer times.\n* **Query optimization:** Parquet and ORC support predicate pushdown, which allows Spark to filter data at the file level, further improving query performance."
