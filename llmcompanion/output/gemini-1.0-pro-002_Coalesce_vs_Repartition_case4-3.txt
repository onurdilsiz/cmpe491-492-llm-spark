```json
{
  "detected": false,
  "occurrences": 0,
  "response": []
}
```

**Explanation:**

After analyzing the provided Spark code, I did not detect any instances where `repartition()` is being used. Therefore, the `occurrences` field is set to 0, and the `response` array remains empty.

The code primarily focuses on defining and utilizing User-Defined Functions (UDFs) and performing string manipulation operations. While `repartition()` could potentially be used in other parts of the codebase, it is not present within the provided snippet.

If you encounter `repartition()` usage in other sections of your code, feel free to provide those snippets for further analysis and potential optimization suggestions.
