```json
{
  "detected": false,
  "occurrences": 0,
  "response": []
}
```

**Explanation:**

After carefully analyzing the provided Spark code, I did not detect any instances where the `repartition()` function is being used. Therefore, the `occurrences` field is set to 0, and the `response` array remains empty.

The code primarily focuses on demonstrating various functionalities within Spark, including:

- Creating a DataFrame using `spark.range()`
- Defining and applying User-Defined Functions (UDFs)
- Using `selectExpr()` for column transformations
- Working with pandas UDFs
- Splitting strings using `split()` function
- Creating and querying temporary views

While `repartition()` is a valuable tool for optimizing data distribution and parallelism in Spark, it is not employed in the given code. Consequently, there are no opportunities to suggest replacing it with `coalesce()` for potential efficiency gains.
