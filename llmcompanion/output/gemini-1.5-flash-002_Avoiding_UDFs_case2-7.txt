      "operation": "Line 30: `A.map(lambda line: [float(n) for n in line.split()])`",
      "improvementExplanation": "This UDF converts each line of the text file into a list of floats.  This can be replaced using Spark's built-in functions.  `split()` can be used to split the lines, and then `cast()` can be used to convert the resulting strings to floats. This avoids the overhead of a user-defined function and allows Spark's optimizer to better plan the execution.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "A = data.select(F.split(F.col(\"value\"), \" \").alias(\"values\")).select([F.col(\"values\").cast(\"array<float>\")])",
      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF enables Catalyst optimizations, leading to improved performance and reduced serialization overhead.  Spark's built-in functions are optimized for distributed processing and can leverage the underlying execution engine more effectively."
    },
    {
      "operation": "Line 48: `A.map(lambda row: np.dot(row, AT_A))`",
      "improvementExplanation": "This UDF performs matrix multiplication of each row of A with AT_A. While NumPy's `dot` is efficient, using it within a Spark `map` operation still involves significant serialization overhead.  A more efficient approach would be to leverage Spark's built-in linear algebra functions or explore using a specialized library like MLlib for large-scale matrix operations.  Directly using NumPy within a Spark UDF limits parallelism and optimization opportunities.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "This requires a more substantial rewrite using Spark's linear algebra capabilities or a library like MLlib. A direct equivalent is not easily provided without restructuring the code significantly to use Spark's distributed matrix operations.  Consider using `pyspark.mllib.linalg` for more efficient large-scale matrix operations.",
      "benefits": "Avoiding this UDF allows Spark to handle the matrix multiplication in a distributed and optimized manner, significantly improving performance and scalability.  It avoids the overhead of serializing and deserializing NumPy arrays across the cluster."
