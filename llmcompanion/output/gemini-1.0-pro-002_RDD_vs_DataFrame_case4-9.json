            "improvementExplanation": "The `delta_mol` function is defined as a User-Defined Function (UDF) that operates on RDDs. This can be inefficient for large datasets as it involves data serialization and deserialization between Python and Java. Additionally, UDFs cannot be optimized by Spark's Catalyst optimizer.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import array_zip_with\n\ndf = df.withColumn('delta_arry', array_zip_with(F.col('array_col'), F.lag('array_col', 1), lambda x, y: (x / y - 1) * 100 if y != 0.0 else 0.0))\n```\nThis code uses the `array_zip_with` function from the DataFrame API to calculate the percentage change between consecutive elements in the `array_col` column. This approach avoids the need for a UDF and leverages Spark's Catalyst optimizer for efficient execution.",
            "benefits": "Replacing the RDD-based UDF with a DataFrame transformation offers several benefits:\n* **Performance improvement:** DataFrame operations are generally faster than RDD operations due to optimized execution plans and reduced data serialization/deserialization.\n* **Scalability:** DataFrames can handle larger datasets more efficiently than RDDs.\n* **Resource efficiency:** DataFrames utilize Spark's Catalyst optimizer, which can significantly reduce the amount of data shuffled and processed, leading to better resource utilization."
