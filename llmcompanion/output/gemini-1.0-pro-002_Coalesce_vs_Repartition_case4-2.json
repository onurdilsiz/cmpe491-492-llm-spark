            "operation": "df.repartition(4)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame to 4. However, since the DataFrame is already partitioned by `gender`, which likely results in a sufficient number of partitions, using `coalesce()` instead would avoid a full shuffle and potentially improve performance.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df.coalesce(4)",
            "benefits": "Replacing `repartition()` with `coalesce()` in this case would:\n- Avoid a full shuffle, as `coalesce()` only redistributes data within existing partitions.\n- Reduce resource usage, as `coalesce()` is generally less resource-intensive than `repartition()`.\n- Potentially improve job runtime by avoiding unnecessary data movement."
