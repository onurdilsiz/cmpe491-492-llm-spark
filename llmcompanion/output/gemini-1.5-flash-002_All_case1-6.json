            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads a text file into an RDD using spark.read.text.  This can be improved by directly reading the data into a DataFrame using a more efficient format like Parquet or ORC, or if the text file is structured, using spark.read.csv or spark.read.json with appropriate schema inference or definition. This allows Spark to leverage its optimized query engine for better performance.",

            "improvementExplanation": "The code uses repartition(200) before writing the data. Repartitioning always triggers a full shuffle, which is expensive. If the number of partitions is already sufficient or needs only a slight reduction, coalesce() is more efficient as it avoids unnecessary shuffling.",

            "benefits": "Reduced data shuffling, improved resource utilization, and faster job runtime. Coalesce is significantly faster than repartition when the target number of partitions is less than or equal to the current number of partitions."

            "improvementExplanation": "The code writes data in CSV format, which is not optimized for Spark.  CSV lacks features like columnar storage and compression, leading to slower read/write operations.  Parquet or ORC are significantly more efficient.",

            "benefits": "Faster read/write operations, better compression, and support for predicate pushdown, leading to improved query performance. Parquet and ORC are columnar storage formats, which are much more efficient for analytical queries than row-oriented formats like CSV."
