            "improvementExplanation": "The map() operation is used to split each line of the text file into a list of values. This operation can be replaced with mapPartitions() because it involves processing each line independently, which is suitable for partition-level processing. By using mapPartitions(), we can reduce the number of function calls and improve the efficiency of the operation.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "parsed_transactions_rdd = transactions_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: (line.split(\",\") for line in partition))",
            "benefits": "Replacing map() with mapPartitions() in this case offers several benefits:\n- Reduced function call overhead: mapPartitions() processes data at the partition level, reducing the number of function calls compared to map().\n- Optimized I/O: mapPartitions() can potentially improve I/O efficiency by reading and processing data in larger chunks.\n- Improved resource utilization: mapPartitions() can lead to better resource utilization by reducing the number of tasks and executors required to process the data."
