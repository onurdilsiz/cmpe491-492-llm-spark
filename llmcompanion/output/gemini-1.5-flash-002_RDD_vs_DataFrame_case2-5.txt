      "rddOperation": "plainText.mapPartitions(lemmaMapper) (line 50)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The RDD mapPartitions operation processes data in partitions.  DataFrames offer optimized execution plans and Catalyst optimizer which can significantly improve performance, especially for large datasets.  Using DataFrames allows for parallel processing and optimized data shuffling.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "Assuming 'plainText' is converted to a DataFrame with columns 'id' and 'text', the equivalent would be:\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import udf\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import ArrayType, StructType, StructField, StringType\n\n# UDF for lemma processing\n@udf(returnType=ArrayType(StructType([StructField('id', StringType()), StructField('lemmas', ArrayType(StringType()))]))) \ndef lemma_udf(id_text_array):\n    pipeline = CoreNLP(configdict={'annotators': \"tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma\"}, corenlp_jars=[ \"./stanford-corenlp-full-2015-04-20/*\"])\n    return [ (id, plainTextToLemmas(text, stopWords, pipeline)) for id, text in id_text_array]\n\n# Apply the UDF\nlemmatized_df = plainText_df.withColumn('lemmas', lemma_udf(array('id', 'text')))\n```",
      "benefits": "DataFrames provide optimized execution plans, leveraging Spark's Catalyst optimizer for improved performance.  This leads to reduced data shuffling and better resource utilization compared to RDD mapPartitions."

      "improvementExplanation": "RDD map operations are less efficient than DataFrame transformations. DataFrames allow for vectorized operations and optimized execution plans.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "This requires restructuring the data into a DataFrame.  A direct equivalent is difficult without knowing the structure of `termWeights`.  A general approach would involve creating a DataFrame from `termWeights` and then using a transformation to achieve the desired mapping.",
      "benefits": "DataFrames offer vectorized operations and optimized execution plans, resulting in faster processing and reduced resource consumption."

      "rddOperation": "sorted(termWeights,key=itemgetter(0),reverse=True) (line 65)",

      "rddOperation": "u.rows.map(lambda r: r[i]) (line 72)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to other map operations, this RDD map can be replaced with a more efficient DataFrame operation.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "This depends on the structure of `u.rows`.  Assuming it can be converted to a DataFrame, a column selection would suffice:\n```python\ndocWeights_df = u_rows_df.select(col(str(i)))\n```",
      "benefits": "DataFrame column selection is highly optimized and avoids the overhead of RDD operations."
