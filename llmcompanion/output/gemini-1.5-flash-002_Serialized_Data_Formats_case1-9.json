            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a CSV file located at hdfs_path_to_csv. CSV is a text-based format, leading to slower read times and larger file sizes compared to binary formats like Parquet or ORC.  Switching to Parquet or ORC will significantly improve read performance due to its columnar storage and efficient compression.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "parquetDF = spark.read.parquet(hdfs_path_to_csv).toDF(\"Path\",\"FileSize\",\"BlocksCount\")",
            "benefits": "Faster read speeds, reduced storage space, and improved query performance due to features like predicate pushdown and columnar storage."

            "operation": "filteredPaths.repartition(1).write.mode('append').format('parquet').saveAsTable(dbName+\".\"+tblName, partitionBy='extract_dt', compression= 'snappy') at line 38",
            "improvementExplanation": "While the code already uses Parquet for writing, the process can be further optimized.  The `saveAsTable` method can be replaced with a direct write to a Parquet file, potentially improving performance by avoiding the overhead of Hive metastore interactions.  Using ORC instead of Parquet might offer even better compression and performance depending on the data characteristics.",

            "benefits": "Faster write speeds, reduced storage space, and potential for improved query performance if the data is subsequently read.  Direct file write can avoid Hive metastore overhead."
