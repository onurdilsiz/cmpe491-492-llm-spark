            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used here to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame before writing it to a CSV file. This can be beneficial for improving write performance, as it allows for parallel writing to multiple files. However, in this case, we can achieve the same goal using `coalesce()` instead, which is more efficient as it avoids a full shuffle. Since we are only writing the data to a single file, we don't need to distribute it across multiple partitions.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df2.coalesce(1).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/repartition/200\")",
            "benefits": "By switching to `coalesce()`, we can avoid the full shuffle operation required by `repartition()`, which can significantly improve the performance of the job. This is because `coalesce()` only redistributes data within existing partitions, while `repartition()` requires a complete reshuffle of the data. Additionally, using `coalesce()` can reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred between executors, leading to improved resource utilization and faster job runtime."
