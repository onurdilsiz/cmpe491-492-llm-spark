      "operation": "repartition(1000)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions to 1000. This can be replaced with `coalesce()` because the goal is to reduce the number of partitions, not increase it. `coalesce()` will merge partitions without shuffling data, which can improve performance.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "coalesce(1000)",
      "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` will reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and potentially lead to faster runtime."
