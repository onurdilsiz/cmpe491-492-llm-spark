      "improvementExplanation": "The UDF `executeRestApi` can be replaced with a combination of built-in functions and DataFrame transformations. Instead of defining a custom UDF, we can use `requests.get` directly within a DataFrame operation. This eliminates the need for serialization and allows Catalyst optimizations to be applied.",

      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with built-in functions and DataFrame transformations offers several benefits:\n\n* **Catalyst Optimizations:** Catalyst can optimize the execution plan for built-in functions and DataFrame operations, leading to improved performance.\n* **Reduced Serialization Overhead:** UDFs require serialization, which can be a performance bottleneck. Using built-in functions and DataFrame operations avoids this overhead.\n* **Improved Code Readability:** Replacing UDFs with built-in functions and DataFrame operations can improve code readability and maintainability."
