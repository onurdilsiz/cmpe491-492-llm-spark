    {
      "operation": "pickle.loads(urllib2.urlopen(request).read()) in get_server_weights function (around line 20)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current implementation uses pickle to serialize and deserialize model weights. Pickle is not designed for efficient distributed processing and lacks features like compression and schema enforcement. Switching to Parquet or ORC would provide significant performance improvements by leveraging columnar storage, compression, and efficient data encoding.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "This requires a more substantial change to the system architecture.  The model weights would need to be saved in Parquet or ORC format to a distributed storage system (like HDFS) accessible by Spark.  The get_server_weights function would then read the weights from this storage using Spark's data reading capabilities.  A complete example is not feasible without knowing the specific storage system and its integration with Spark.",
      "benefits": "Faster reads and writes due to columnar storage and compression. Improved scalability and fault tolerance due to the use of a distributed storage system.  Potential for predicate pushdown optimization if the data is structured appropriately."

    {
      "operation": "pickle.dumps(delta, -1) and pickle.loads(request.data) in put_deltas_to_server and update_parameters functions (around lines 26 and 76)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the previous case, using pickle for transferring model weight deltas is inefficient.  Parquet or ORC would offer better performance and scalability for this inter-process communication.  However, this would require a significant redesign of the communication protocol between the workers and the parameter server.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "This would involve a complete rewrite of the communication layer.  The deltas would need to be structured as a Parquet or ORC file, written to a shared storage location, and then read by the parameter server.  A complete example is not feasible without knowing the specific storage system and its integration with Spark.",
      "benefits": "Faster data transfer due to efficient serialization and compression. Improved scalability and fault tolerance.  Reduced network overhead."
