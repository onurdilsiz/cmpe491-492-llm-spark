            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition(50)` operation is used before writing the DataFrame to CSV.  Since the purpose is to write the data to a file system, the number of partitions only affects the number of files written.  If the number of partitions in `df2` is less than or equal to 50, a full shuffle is unnecessary.  `coalesce` can reduce the number of partitions without shuffling if the target number is less than or equal to the current number of partitions. If the current number of partitions is greater than 50, `coalesce` will still perform a shuffle, but it might be more efficient than `repartition` in some cases because it avoids unnecessary data movement.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df2.coalesce(50).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/coalesce/50\")",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce` can significantly reduce the shuffle time and improve overall performance, especially if the initial number of partitions is already less than or equal to 50.  It leads to reduced resource consumption (CPU, memory, and network bandwidth) and faster job completion."
