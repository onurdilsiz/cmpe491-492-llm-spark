    {
      "operation": "Line 16: parsed_ratings = raw_ratings.map(lambda line: line.split(','))",
      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation splits each line of the input file.  This is an I/O-bound operation, and performing it within each partition using mapPartitions would reduce the overhead of repeatedly calling the split function for each line individually.  mapPartitions allows for batch processing of lines within a partition, leading to efficiency gains.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "parsed_ratings = raw_ratings.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: [line.split(',') for line in iterator])",
      "benefits": "Reduced function call overhead, improved I/O efficiency by processing multiple lines at once within each partition."
    },
    {
      "operation": "Line 21: movie_counts = high_ratings.map(lambda x: (x[1], 1))",
      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation transforms each rating into a key-value pair. While not inherently I/O bound, processing multiple records at once within a partition using mapPartitions can still reduce the function call overhead, especially with large datasets.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "movie_counts = high_ratings.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: [(x[1], 1) for x in iterator])",
      "benefits": "Reduced function call overhead, potentially improved performance due to batch processing."
    },
    {
      "operation": "Line 27: movie_count_key = movie_rating_counts.map(lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))",
      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation swaps the key and value. Similar to the previous case, using mapPartitions can reduce function call overhead.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "movie_count_key = movie_rating_counts.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: [(x[1], x[0]) for x in iterator])",
      "benefits": "Reduced function call overhead, potentially improved performance due to batch processing."

    {
      "operation": "Line 36: movie_ratings = parsed_ratings.map(lambda x: (x[1], (float(x[2]), 1)))",
      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation transforms each rating into a key-value pair for aggregation.  Similar to previous cases, mapPartitions can reduce function call overhead.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "movie_ratings = parsed_ratings.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: [(x[1], (float(x[2]), 1)) for x in iterator])",

      "operation": "Line 46: movie_average_ratings = movie_rating_totals.map(lambda x: (x[0], x[1][0] / x[1][1]))",
      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation calculates the average rating.  Again, mapPartitions can reduce function call overhead.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "movie_average_ratings = movie_rating_totals.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: [(x[0], x[1][0] / x[1][1]) for x in iterator])",

    {
      "operation": "Line 56: final_movies = popular_movies.map(lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))",
      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation is a simple identity transformation. While the benefit might be minimal in this specific case, using mapPartitions maintains consistency and could offer slight performance improvements in scenarios with more complex transformations within the lambda function.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "final_movies = popular_movies.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: [(x[0], x[1]) for x in iterator])",
      "benefits": "Maintains consistency with other map operations; potentially minor performance improvement due to reduced function call overhead."
