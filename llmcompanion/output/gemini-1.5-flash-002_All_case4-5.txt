However, the subsequent `write_to_protobuf` function uses `df.rdd.collect()`, which brings all data to the driver, negating the benefits of distributed processing.  The entire pipeline should leverage DataFrames for better performance and scalability.",

      "alternativeEquivalent": "A complex transformation like this is difficult to replace entirely without rewriting the logic.
