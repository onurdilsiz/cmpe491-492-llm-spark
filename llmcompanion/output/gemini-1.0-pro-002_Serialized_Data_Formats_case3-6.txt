      "operation": "Read CSV file into DataFrame (line 27)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current CSV format is not optimized for Spark processing. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance due to columnar storage, compression, and efficient data encoding.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\ncustomerDF = spark.read.parquet(\"retailstore.parquet\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Faster read performance, reduced storage footprint due to compression, and improved query optimization through predicate pushdown."

      "operation": "Write DataFrame to CSV file (not explicitly shown, but assumed based on common data analysis workflows)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Writing the DataFrame back to CSV would negate the performance gains achieved by reading from Parquet. It's recommended to keep the data in Parquet format for subsequent analysis.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\ncustomerDF.write.parquet(\"retailstore_processed.parquet\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Preserves the benefits of Parquet format for future analysis, avoids unnecessary data conversion overhead."
