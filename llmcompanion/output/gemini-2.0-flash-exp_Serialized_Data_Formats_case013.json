            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads transaction data from a text file. Text files are not optimized for analytical workloads. Each line needs to be parsed, which is inefficient. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance, especially for large datasets, as it allows for predicate pushdown and efficient column-wise access.",

            "improvementExplanation": "The code saves the filtered transactions in CSV format. CSV is a row-based format and is not optimized for analytical queries. It lacks schema information and does not support efficient compression or predicate pushdown. Switching to Parquet or ORC would improve write performance, reduce storage space, and enable faster subsequent reads.",
