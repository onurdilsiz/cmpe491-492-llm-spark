            "operation": "The UDF `check_prem_typ_desc` is used on line 14 to check the length of the 17th element in each row and return a string based on the result.",
            "improvementExplanation": "This UDF can be replaced with a combination of built-in functions and transformations. We can use `length` function to get the length of the string and then use an `if` condition to check if the length is 0. If the length is 0, we can return 'NULL\tNULL\tNULL', otherwise we can return 'TEXT\tPREMISES\tVALID'. This approach avoids the overhead of creating and registering a UDF.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "```python\nresults = lines.map(lambda x: 'NULL\tNULL\tNULL' if len(x[16]) == 0 else 'TEXT\tPREMISES\tVALID')\n```",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with built-in functions and transformations offers several benefits:\n* **Enables Catalyst optimizations:** Catalyst optimizer can analyze and optimize the code, leading to better performance.\n* **Improves performance:** Avoiding UDFs reduces serialization overhead and improves execution speed.\n* **Reduces code complexity:** Using built-in functions and transformations makes the code more concise and easier to understand."
