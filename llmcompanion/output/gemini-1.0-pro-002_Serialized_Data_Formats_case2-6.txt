      "improvementExplanation": "HBase is a NoSQL database that stores data in key-value pairs. While it offers high scalability and real-time data access, it can be less efficient for analytical workloads compared to optimized serialized formats like Parquet or ORC. These formats provide faster reads/writes, compression, and query optimization through predicate pushdown.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Replace HBase with Parquet\ninput_rdd = sc.read.parquet(\"/path/to/parseddata_sample.parquet\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC can significantly improve performance by:\n- Reducing read/write times due to efficient data organization and compression.\n- Enabling faster queries through predicate pushdown, where filters are applied directly on the compressed data without decompressing the entire dataset."
