            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition(1)` operation is used to reduce the number of partitions in the DataFrame. However, since the DataFrame is already partitioned by the Kinesis stream, further reducing the number of partitions is unnecessary. Instead, we can use `coalesce(1)` to simply combine the existing partitions without shuffling the data.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "azureAuditLog_df_dynf = DynamicFrame.fromDF(azureAuditLog_df, glueContext, \"dynamic_frame\").coalesce(1)",
            "benefits": "Replacing `repartition(1)` with `coalesce(1)` will avoid unnecessary shuffling, which can significantly improve the performance of the job. Additionally, coalesce() is more efficient than repartition() as it does not require a full shuffle."
