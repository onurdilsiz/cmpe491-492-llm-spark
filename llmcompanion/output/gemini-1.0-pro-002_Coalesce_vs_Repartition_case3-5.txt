      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the RDD to 100. However, since the subsequent operations do not require a full shuffle, using `coalesce()` instead would achieve the same result without incurring the overhead of shuffling data across the cluster. This would lead to reduced shuffling, improved resource usage, and faster job runtime.",
