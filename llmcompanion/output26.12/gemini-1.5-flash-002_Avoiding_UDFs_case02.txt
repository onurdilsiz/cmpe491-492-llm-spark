    {
      "operation": "lambda line: line.split(',') in line 13",
      "improvementExplanation": "This UDF splits each line of the input text file into an array of strings.  This can be replaced by using Spark's built-in CSV parsing capabilities within a DataFrame.  Processing data as a DataFrame allows for optimized execution plans and parallel processing.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "employee_df = spark.read.csv('path/to/employees.txt', header=False, inferSchema=True)\nhigh_salary_df = employee_df.filter(employee_df[\"salary\"] > 50000)",
      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with DataFrame operations enables Catalyst optimizations, leading to improved performance and reduced serialization overhead.  DataFrames provide a more efficient and scalable way to handle large datasets compared to RDDs."
    },
    {
      "operation": "lambda emp: float(emp[2]) > 50000 in line 14",
      "improvementExplanation": "This UDF filters employees based on salary. This can be directly achieved using the DataFrame's filter method with a SQL expression.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "high_salary_df = employee_df.filter(\"salary > 50000\")",
      "benefits": "Using DataFrame's filter method with a SQL expression allows Spark's optimizer to generate a more efficient execution plan, leading to better performance and reduced overhead compared to using a UDF.  It also improves code readability."

      "operation": "lambda emp: (emp[0], emp[1], float(emp[2]) * 1.1) in line 18",

      "alternativeEquivalent": "bonus_df = high_salary_df.withColumn(\"bonus\", high_salary_df[\"salary\"] * 1.1)",
      "benefits": "Using withColumn with built-in functions allows Spark's optimizer to generate a more efficient execution plan, leading to better performance and reduced overhead compared to using a UDF. It also improves code readability and maintainability."
