      "operation": "Line 30: `A.map(lambda line: [float(n) for n in line.split()])`",
      "improvementExplanation": "This UDF converts each line of text into a list of floats.  This can be replaced using Spark's built-in functions.  `split()` can be used to split the string, and then `cast()` can be used to convert each element to a float. This avoids the overhead of a user-defined function and allows Spark's optimizer to better plan the execution.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "A = data.select(F.split(F.col(\"value\"), \" \").alias(\"values\")).select([F.col(\"values\").cast(\"array<float>\")])",
      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF enables Catalyst optimizations, leading to improved performance and reduced serialization overhead.  Spark's built-in functions are optimized for distributed processing and can leverage vectorized operations for faster execution."
    },
    {
      "operation": "Line 48: `A.map(lambda row: np.dot(row, AT_A))`",
      "improvementExplanation": "This UDF performs matrix multiplication of each row of A with AT_A. While NumPy's `dot` is efficient, using it within a Spark `map` operation still incurs serialization overhead.  A more efficient approach would be to leverage Spark's built-in linear algebra functions or explore using a specialized library like MLlib for large-scale matrix operations.  Directly using NumPy within a Spark UDF limits the ability of Spark's optimizer to parallelize the computation effectively.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "This requires a more substantial rewrite using Spark's linear algebra capabilities or a library like MLlib. A direct equivalent is not easily provided without restructuring the code significantly to use Spark's distributed matrix operations.  Consider using `pyspark.mllib.linalg` for more efficient large-scale matrix operations.",
      "benefits": "Avoiding this UDF allows Spark to handle the matrix multiplication in a distributed manner, leveraging its optimized execution engine. This significantly improves performance and scalability compared to processing the entire matrix on a single machine.  It also reduces the data transfer overhead associated with serializing and deserializing data between the driver and executors."
