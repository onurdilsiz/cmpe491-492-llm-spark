            "operation": "rdd2 = rdd2.repartition(4)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(4) operation is used to increase the number of partitions to 4 for better parallelism. However, in this case, the operation does not require a full shuffle as it only needs to reduce the partitions without changing the data distribution.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "rdd2 = rdd2.coalesce(2)",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce(2) reduces unnecessary shuffling, optimizes resource usage, and potentially speeds up the job execution by avoiding a full shuffle operation."
