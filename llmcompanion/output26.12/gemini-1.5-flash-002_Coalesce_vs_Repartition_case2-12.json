            "improvementExplanation": "In this instance, `repartition(partitions)` is used within the `CCIndexSparkJob` class's `load_dataframe` method.  The purpose is to redistribute the data across a specified number of partitions. However, since this operation follows a data loading step, it's likely that the data is already partitioned.  Using `repartition` will trigger a full shuffle, which is computationally expensive.  `coalesce` can achieve the same partition reduction without a full shuffle if the target number of partitions is less than or equal to the current number of partitions.  If the number of partitions is greater than the current number, `coalesce` will still perform a shuffle, but it will be less expensive than `repartition` because it will only shuffle the necessary data.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "sqldf = sqldf.coalesce(partitions)",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce` will reduce the amount of data shuffled, leading to improved resource usage and faster job runtime. If the number of target partitions is less than or equal to the current number of partitions, it will avoid a full shuffle altogether."
