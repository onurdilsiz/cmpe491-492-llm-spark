            "operation": "parsed_employee_rdd.map(lambda line: line.split(\",\"))",
            "improvementExplanation": "The map() transformation is used to split each line of the RDD into a list based on the comma delimiter. This operation can be performed more efficiently at the partition level using mapPartitions() to reduce function call overhead.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "parsed_employee_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda iter: (line.split(\",\") for line in iter))",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() can optimize the splitting operation by processing multiple lines within a partition at once, reducing the overhead of invoking the lambda function for each line individually."

            "operation": "department_salary_rdd.map(lambda emp: (emp[2], float(emp[3]))",
            "improvementExplanation": "The map() transformation extracts the department and salary information from each record. By using mapPartitions(), this extraction can be done more efficiently at the partition level, especially for I/O-heavy operations or batch processing.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "department_salary_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda iter: ((emp[2], float(emp[3])) for emp in iter))",
            "benefits": "Replacing map() with mapPartitions() can improve performance by reducing the number of function calls and enhancing resource utilization, particularly for operations that benefit from processing data in batches within partitions."
