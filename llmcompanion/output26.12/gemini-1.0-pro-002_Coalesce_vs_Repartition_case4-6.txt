**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of `repartition()`. Therefore, there are no opportunities to replace it with `coalesce()` for improved efficiency. The code primarily focuses on defining user-defined functions (UDFs) for data transformation and cleaning tasks. These UDFs are likely used within a Spark DataFrame or Dataset to manipulate and prepare data for further analysis.

While `repartition()` and `coalesce()` are both used to adjust the number of partitions in a DataFrame, they have distinct purposes and performance implications. `repartition()` triggers a full shuffle, distributing data across the specified number of partitions, regardless of the existing partition structure. This can be computationally expensive and time-consuming for large datasets.

In contrast, `coalesce()` aims to reduce the number of partitions without shuffling the entire dataset. It merges existing partitions to achieve the desired partition count. This operation is generally more efficient than `repartition()` when the goal is simply to reduce the number of partitions without altering the data distribution.

In the absence of `repartition()` usage, there's no scope for suggesting `coalesce()` as a replacement. The provided code snippet focuses on data transformation and cleaning, which are essential steps in data preparation but do not directly involve partition manipulation.
