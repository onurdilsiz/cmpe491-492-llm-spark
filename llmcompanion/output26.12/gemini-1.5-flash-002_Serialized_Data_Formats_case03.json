            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads employee data from a text file (presumably CSV) using RDDs.  This is inefficient for large datasets.  Using a DataFrame and reading directly from a Parquet or ORC file would significantly improve performance.  Parquet and ORC offer columnar storage, compression, and efficient predicate pushdown, leading to faster query execution and reduced I/O.",

            "improvementExplanation": "Writing to CSV is inefficient for large datasets.  CSV is a row-oriented format with no compression.  Parquet or ORC provide columnar storage, compression, and better performance for writing and reading large datasets.  They also support schema enforcement, improving data integrity.",
