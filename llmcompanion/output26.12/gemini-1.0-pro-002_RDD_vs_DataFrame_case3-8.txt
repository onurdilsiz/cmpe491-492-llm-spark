      "rddOperation": "train_rbm(myFaceEmbeddingsData, sc, 128, 20)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `train_rbm` function appears to be using an RDD to train a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). RDDs are a fundamental data structure in Apache Spark, but they can be less efficient than DataFrames/Datasets for certain tasks, especially machine learning. DataFrames/Datasets offer higher-level abstractions and optimizations that can lead to improved performance and scalability.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\nimport pyspark.sql.functions as F\n\n# Assuming `myFaceEmbeddingsData` is a DataFrame\nrbm = pyspark.ml.recommendation.ALS()\n  .setRank(128)\n  .setMaxIter(20)\n  .fit(myFaceEmbeddingsData)\n```",
      "benefits": "Using a DataFrame/Dataset for RBM training can provide the following benefits:\n\n* **Performance:** DataFrames/Datasets leverage Spark's Catalyst Optimizer, which can significantly improve query execution plans and optimize data processing.
* **Scalability:** DataFrames/Datasets are designed to handle large datasets efficiently, making them more scalable for training complex models like RBMs.
* **Resource Efficiency:** DataFrames/Datasets can reduce memory usage and garbage collection overhead compared to RDDs, leading to more efficient resource utilization.
* **Code Simplicity:** DataFrames/Datasets offer a more concise and readable syntax for data manipulation and machine learning tasks."
