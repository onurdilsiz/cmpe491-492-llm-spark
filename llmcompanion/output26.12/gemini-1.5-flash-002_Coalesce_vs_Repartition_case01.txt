      "operation": "repartitioned_df = electronics_sales_df.repartition(10)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code uses `repartition(10)` to increase the number of partitions to 10 before writing the DataFrame.  Since the goal is likely to write the data to a file system, and the number of partitions is increased, this operation causes a full shuffle across the cluster, which is inefficient if the current number of partitions is already sufficient or greater than 10.  If the number of partitions is less than 10, `coalesce` can be used to reduce the number of partitions without shuffling. If the number of partitions is already greater than or equal to 10, `repartition` is unnecessary.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "If electronics_sales_df.rdd.getNumPartitions() < 10:\n    repartitioned_df = electronics_sales_df.coalesce(10)",
      "benefits": "Using `coalesce` instead of `repartition` when the number of partitions is less than 10 avoids a full data shuffle, leading to reduced network traffic, improved resource utilization, and faster job execution. If the number of partitions is already greater than or equal to 10, removing the `repartition` call entirely will improve performance."
