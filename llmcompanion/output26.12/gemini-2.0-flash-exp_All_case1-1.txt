      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition(50)` operation forces a full shuffle of the data across all partitions, which can be expensive. Since the goal is to reduce the number of partitions for writing, `coalesce(50)` can be used instead. `coalesce` attempts to reduce the number of partitions without a full shuffle, which is more efficient when reducing the number of partitions.",

      "benefits": "Using `coalesce` instead of `repartition` reduces shuffling, which leads to improved resource usage and faster job runtime. It avoids a full shuffle when reducing the number of partitions, making it more efficient."
