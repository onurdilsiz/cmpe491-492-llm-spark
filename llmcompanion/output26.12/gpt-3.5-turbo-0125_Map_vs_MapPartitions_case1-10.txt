            "improvementExplanation": "The map() transformation is used to process each line of the input text file individually, which can lead to high function call overhead and potentially inefficient I/O operations when handling small tasks per element. By using mapPartitions(), we can process multiple elements within a partition at once, reducing the overhead of function calls and improving performance for I/O-heavy operations like downloading and storing files.",

            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() allows for processing multiple elements within a partition at once, reducing function call overhead and potentially improving performance for I/O-heavy operations like downloading and storing files."
