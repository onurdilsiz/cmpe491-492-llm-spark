    {
      "rddOperation": "map",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `map` operation is used to parse each line of the text file into a tuple. This can be done more efficiently using the DataFrame/Dataset API's built-in parsing capabilities.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\n# Read the text file as a DataFrame\nemployee_df = spark.read.text(\"path/to/employees.txt\")\n\n# Parse the DataFrame columns\nemployee_df = employee_df.withColumn(\"employee_id\", F.split(F.col(\"value\"), \",\")[0])\n.withColumn(\"name\", F.split(F.col(\"value\"), \",\")[1])\n.withColumn(\"salary\", F.split(F.col(\"value\"), \",\")[2])\n```",
      "benefits": "Using DataFrame/Dataset for parsing provides better performance due to optimized data structures and vectorized operations. It also reduces the need for manual parsing logic."
    },
    {
      "rddOperation": "filter",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `filter` operation is used to select employees with salaries above 50,000. DataFrame/Dataset provides more efficient filtering capabilities using SQL-like expressions.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\n# Filter employees with high salaries\nhigh_salary_df = employee_df.filter(F.col(\"salary\") > 50000)\n```",
      "benefits": "DataFrame/Dataset filtering leverages optimized query plans and avoids unnecessary data processing, leading to faster execution and reduced resource consumption."
    },
    {
      "rddOperation": "map",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `map` operation is used to calculate bonuses for high-salary employees. DataFrame/Dataset offers vectorized operations like `withColumn` for efficient calculations.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\n# Calculate bonuses for high-salary employees\nbonus_df = high_salary_df.withColumn(\"bonus\", F.col(\"salary\") * 1.1)\n```",
      "benefits": "Vectorized operations in DataFrame/Dataset significantly improve performance compared to per-element processing in RDDs. They also reduce the risk of errors and improve code readability."
