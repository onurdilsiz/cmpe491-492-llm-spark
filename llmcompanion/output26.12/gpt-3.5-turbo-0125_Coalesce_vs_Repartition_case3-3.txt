            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used to evenly redistribute data across partitions after dropping rows with null values. However, in this case, the operation does not require a full shuffle as the data size remains the same. Using coalesce() instead of repartition() can efficiently reduce the number of partitions without shuffling the data.",

            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() will avoid unnecessary shuffling, leading to improved resource usage and faster job runtime."
