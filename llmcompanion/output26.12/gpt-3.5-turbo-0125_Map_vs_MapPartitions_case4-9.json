            "improvementExplanation": "The map() transformation is used in the UDF 'delta_mol' to calculate differences between consecutive elements in an array. This operation can be performed more efficiently at the partition level using mapPartitions() to reduce function call overhead and improve performance.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "Replace the map() transformation in 'delta_mol' UDF with mapPartitions() to process the array elements at the partition level.",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() can optimize the computation by processing elements in batches at the partition level, reducing the overhead of function calls for each element. This can lead to improved performance and resource utilization, especially for I/O-heavy operations."
