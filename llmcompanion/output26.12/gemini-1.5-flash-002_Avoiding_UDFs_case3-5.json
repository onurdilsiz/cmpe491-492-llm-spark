            "operation": "def haversine(lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2): ...",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `haversine` function calculates the great-circle distance between two points.  Spark doesn't have a built-in haversine function, but the calculation can be expressed using built-in trigonometric functions within a Spark SQL expression or a higher-order function. This avoids the overhead of a UDF.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "This requires a more complex expression within a Spark function, potentially using a higher-order function to apply it to each row. A custom function might still be slightly more readable, but the performance gains from avoiding a UDF would likely outweigh this.",
            "benefits": "Avoids UDF serialization overhead, enabling Catalyst optimization and potentially improving performance through vectorized processing."

            "operation": "def gaussian_kernel(x,h): ...",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `gaussian_kernel` function calculates the Gaussian kernel. This can be directly replaced with Spark's built-in `exp` function within a Spark SQL expression or a higher-order function.",

            "improvementExplanation": "The `get_k_dist` function combines `haversine` and `gaussian_kernel`. As `haversine` can be improved as described above, and `gaussian_kernel` can be replaced with `exp`, this function can be replaced by combining those improvements.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "This would involve a more complex expression within a Spark function, potentially using a higher-order function to apply it to each row.  The performance gains from avoiding a UDF would likely outweigh the increased complexity.",

            "improvementExplanation": "The `get_k_days` function calculates the difference in days and applies the Gaussian kernel. The date difference can be calculated using Spark's built-in date functions, and the Gaussian kernel can be replaced with `exp` as before.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import datediff, exp\n... \nexp(-(datediff(pred_day, day)/h)**2)\n```",
