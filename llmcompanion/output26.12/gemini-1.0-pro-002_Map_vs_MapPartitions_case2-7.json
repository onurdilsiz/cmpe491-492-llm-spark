            "operation": "Multiply A.T * A (line 24)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The operation involves multiplying each row of A with its transpose and accumulating the results in a matrix. This can be efficiently performed at the partition level using `mapPartitions()` to avoid unnecessary function calls and I/O overhead for each individual row.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\n# Multiply A.T * A using mapPartitions()\nAT_A = np.zeros((1000,1000)) # Initialize AT_A\nstart = time.time()\nAT_A = A.mapPartitions(lambda part: np.sum([np.outer(row, row) for row in part], axis=0)).reduce(add)\nstep1 = time.time()\nprint(f\"\\n Time for A^T* * A = {step1-start:.4f}\")\n```",
            "benefits": "Replacing `map()` with `mapPartitions()` in this case offers several benefits:\n\n* **Reduced function call overhead:** By processing data in batches within partitions, we avoid the overhead of calling the `np.outer()` function for each individual row.\n* **Optimized I/O:** Data is processed within partitions, minimizing the need to shuffle data across the cluster for intermediate results.\n* **Improved resource utilization:** By performing the operation at the partition level, we can potentially utilize multiple cores within each executor, leading to faster execution times."
