      "improvementExplanation": "Reading data directly from a CSV file using pandas is inefficient in a Spark application.  Pandas loads the entire CSV into the driver's memory, which can cause out-of-memory errors for large datasets.  Spark's DataFrame API provides optimized methods for reading and processing large datasets in a distributed manner.  Using a columnar storage format like Parquet will significantly improve read performance and enable better compression.",
