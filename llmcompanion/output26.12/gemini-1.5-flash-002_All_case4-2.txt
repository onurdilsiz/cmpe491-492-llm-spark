    {
      "operation": "The code uses the `create_standard_df()` function which likely reads data from a CSV or other non-optimized format.  The exact location is not shown but it's implied by the function call on line 11.",
      "improvementExplanation": "Reading data directly from CSV can be slow.  Using a columnar format like Parquet significantly improves read and write performance, enabling better compression and query optimization.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "Assuming `create_standard_df()` reads from a CSV file named 'data.csv':\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"ParquetConversion\").getOrCreate()\ndf = spark.read.csv('data.csv', header=True, inferSchema=True)\ndf.write.parquet('data.parquet')\ndf_parquet = spark.read.parquet('data.parquet')\n```",
