            "improvementExplanation": "In this context, repartition(50) is used to increase the number of partitions to 50 before writing the data to a CSV file. However, since the goal is to reduce the number of partitions for better efficiency and resource utilization, coalesce() can be used instead of repartition().",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df_5years.coalesce(50).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").mode(\"overwrite\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000-2005/repartition/50\")",
            "benefits": "By replacing repartition(50) with coalesce(50), the operation will avoid a full shuffle and simply reduce the number of partitions to 50, leading to improved resource usage, reduced shuffling, and potentially faster job runtime."
