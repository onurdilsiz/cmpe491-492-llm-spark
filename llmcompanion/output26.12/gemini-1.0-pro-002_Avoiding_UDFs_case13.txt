```json
{
  "detected": false,
  "occurrences": 0,
  "response": []
}
```

**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of User-Defined Functions (UDFs). Therefore, the `detected` field is set to `false`, and the `occurrences` field is set to `0`. Consequently, the `response` array is empty.

**Analysis:**

The code demonstrates various Spark operations, including DataFrame creation, filtering, and saving data. However, it does not involve any custom functions defined by the user. All operations are performed using Spark's built-in functions and DataFrame/Dataset transformations.

**Benefits of Avoiding UDFs:**

While UDFs can be useful in certain scenarios, they can also introduce performance overhead and limit Catalyst optimization capabilities. By leveraging Spark's built-in functions and native DataFrame/Dataset operations, we can achieve the following benefits:

- **Improved Performance:** Built-in functions and native operations are often optimized for performance, leading to faster execution times.
- **Catalyst Optimization:** Spark's Catalyst optimizer can effectively optimize queries that use built-in functions and native operations, resulting in more efficient execution plans.
- **Reduced Serialization Overhead:** UDFs require serialization and deserialization, which can add overhead. Using built-in functions and native operations avoids this overhead.

**Conclusion:**

The provided Spark code effectively utilizes Spark's built-in functions and native DataFrame/Dataset operations, demonstrating efficient data processing without the need for UDFs. This approach ensures optimal performance, Catalyst optimization, and reduced serialization overhead.
