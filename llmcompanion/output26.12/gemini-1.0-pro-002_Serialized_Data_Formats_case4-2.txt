      "operation": "Reading data from a CSV file",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current code reads data from a CSV file, which is a text-based format. This can be inefficient for large datasets, as it requires parsing and converting the data into a structured format. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read data from a Parquet file\ndf = spark.read.parquet('/path/to/parquet/file')\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC offers several benefits:\n* **Faster reads/writes:** Serialized formats are optimized for reading and writing large datasets, resulting in significantly faster performance compared to text-based formats like CSV.\n* **Compression:** Parquet and ORC support efficient compression, which can reduce storage requirements and improve data transfer speeds.\n* **Query optimization:** These formats allow for predicate pushdown, where filters are applied directly to the data files, further improving query performance."
