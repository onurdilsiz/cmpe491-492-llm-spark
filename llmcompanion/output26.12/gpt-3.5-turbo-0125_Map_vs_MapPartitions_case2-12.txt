            "improvementExplanation": "The map() operation is used to process each element individually, which can lead to high function call overhead when dealing with I/O-heavy operations like reading from S3 or HDFS. By using mapPartitions(), we can process multiple elements within a partition at once, reducing the overhead of function calls and improving performance.",

            "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the previous case, using map() to process individual elements can be inefficient for I/O-heavy operations like fetching and processing WARC records. By switching to mapPartitions(), we can process multiple records within a partition, leading to better performance and resource utilization.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "output = warc_recs.mapPartitions(self.fetch_process_warc_records)",
            "benefits": "Replacing map() with mapPartitions() in this scenario can reduce function call overhead, optimize I/O operations, and improve overall performance when dealing with partition-level processing of WARC records."
