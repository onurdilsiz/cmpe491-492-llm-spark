      "operation": "parsed_transactions_rdd = transactions_rdd.map(lambda line: line.split(\",\"))  # Inefficient RDD processing",
      "improvementExplanation": "The map() operation in this case is used to split each line of the text file into a list of values based on the comma delimiter. This operation can be efficiently performed at the partition level using mapPartitions() instead of map(). By processing data in batches within each partition, mapPartitions() can reduce function call overhead and improve I/O performance.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "parsed_transactions_rdd = transactions_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: (line.split(\",\") for line in partition))",
      "benefits": "Replacing map() with mapPartitions() in this case will provide the following benefits:\n- Reduced function call overhead: By processing data in batches within each partition, mapPartitions() avoids the overhead of calling the splitting function for each individual line.\n- Optimized I/O: mapPartitions() can potentially optimize I/O operations by reading and processing data in larger chunks within each partition.\n- Improved resource utilization: By reducing function call overhead and optimizing I/O, mapPartitions() can improve the overall resource utilization of the Spark job."
