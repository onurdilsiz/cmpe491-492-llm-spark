            "operation": "usd_transactions_df.repartition(10)  # Inefficiently increasing partitions",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame to 10. However, since the DataFrame is already filtered to only include USD transactions, it is likely that the number of partitions is already smaller than 10. In this case, using `coalesce()` instead of `repartition()` would be more efficient as it would only reduce the number of partitions without performing a full shuffle.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "usd_transactions_df.coalesce(10)",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` would reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and potentially lead to a faster job runtime."
