            "improvementExplanation": "The code accesses the RDD using repartitioned_df.rdd. This is unnecessary and can be avoided by using DataFrame/Dataset operations.  DataFrames provide optimized execution plans and leverage Spark's Catalyst optimizer, leading to better performance.",

If you need the number of partitions, use repartitioned_df.rdd.getNumPartitions().  However, most operations should be done directly on the DataFrame.",
