      "improvementExplanation": "This map() operation iterates over each partition of the RDD and applies the `find_candidate` function to each partition. This function performs counting and filtering operations on each item within the partition. Since these operations can be efficiently performed at the partition level, replacing map() with mapPartitions() can significantly improve performance by reducing function call overhead and optimizing I/O.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "user_basket.mapPartitions(lambda partition: find_candidate(basket=partition, sub_support=sub_support))",
      "benefits": "Replacing map() with mapPartitions() in this case offers several benefits:\n- **Reduced function call overhead:** By processing data at the partition level, we avoid unnecessary function calls for each individual item.\n- **Optimized I/O:** Data processing and filtering happen within each partition, minimizing data shuffling across the cluster.\n- **Improved resource utilization:** By processing data in parallel across partitions, we can utilize multiple cores and improve overall processing speed."

      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the previous case, this map() operation iterates over each partition and applies the `find_final` function to each partition. This function performs filtering and counting operations on each item within the partition. Replacing map() with mapPartitions() can again improve performance by reducing function call overhead and optimizing I/O.",
