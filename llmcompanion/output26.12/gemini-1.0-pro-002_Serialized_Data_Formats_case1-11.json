            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads data from a NETCDF file using the iris library. This format is not optimized for Spark and can lead to slower processing times. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve performance due to faster reads/writes, compression, and query optimization through predicate pushdown.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nimport pyarrow.parquet as pq\n\n# Download NETCDF file into local bucket\ns3 = boto3.resource('s3')\nraw_data_bucket = get_bucket_links()\ns3.Bucket(raw_data_bucket).download_file(file_name, 'tmp.nc')\n\n# Convert NETCDF data to Parquet format\ntable = pq.read_table('tmp.nc')\ntable.write('tmp.parquet')\n\n# Load Parquet data into Spark DataFrame\ndf = spark.read.parquet('tmp.parquet')\n\n# Delete temporary files\nos.remove('tmp.nc')\nos.remove('tmp.parquet')\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC format offers several benefits:\n* **Faster reads/writes:** Serialized formats like Parquet and ORC are optimized for Spark, resulting in faster data loading and processing times.\n* **Compression:** These formats compress data efficiently, reducing storage requirements and network transfer times.\n* **Query optimization:** Parquet and ORC support predicate pushdown, allowing Spark to filter data before reading it, further improving query performance."
