      "improvementExplanation": "The `generate_rolling_aggregate` UDF likely performs a rolling aggregation. This can be replaced using Spark's built-in window functions.  The UDF likely involves custom logic for handling the time window and aggregation, which can be achieved more efficiently with Spark's optimized window functions.",
