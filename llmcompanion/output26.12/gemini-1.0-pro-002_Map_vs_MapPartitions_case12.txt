      "operation": "sales_rdd.map(lambda row: (row[\"sale_id\"], row[\"category\"], row[\"amount\"] * 0.9))",
      "improvementExplanation": "This map() operation applies a discount calculation to each individual sale record. However, this can be inefficient due to the overhead of function calls and potential I/O operations for each element. By using mapPartitions(), we can process the data in batches at the partition level, reducing function call overhead and potentially optimizing I/O for batch operations.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "sales_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: [(row[\"sale_id\"], row[\"category\"], row[\"amount\"] * 0.9) for row in partition])",
      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() in this case can provide the following benefits:\n- Reduced function call overhead: By processing data in batches, we avoid the overhead of calling the discount calculation function for each individual record.\n- Optimized I/O: If the discount calculation involves accessing external data sources, batching the operations can improve I/O efficiency.\n- Improved resource utilization: Processing data in batches can lead to better CPU and memory utilization, especially when dealing with large datasets."
