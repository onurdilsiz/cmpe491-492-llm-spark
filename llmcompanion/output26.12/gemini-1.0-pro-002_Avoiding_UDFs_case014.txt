    {
      "operation": "UDF for generating custom messages (line 27-31)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The UDF `generate_message` can be replaced with Spark SQL's built-in `concat` function to create the same message. This avoids the overhead of defining and registering a UDF, enabling Catalyst optimizations and potentially improving performance.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "```python\ntransactions_with_message_df = repartitioned_df.withColumn(\"transaction_message\", concat(lit(\"Category: \"), repartitioned_df[\"category\"], lit(\", Amount: $\"), repartitioned_df[\"amount\"]))\n```",
      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with a built-in function provides the following benefits:\n- Enables Catalyst optimizations for better query planning and execution.\n- Improves performance by avoiding UDF serialization and execution overhead.\n- Reduces code complexity and maintenance effort."
