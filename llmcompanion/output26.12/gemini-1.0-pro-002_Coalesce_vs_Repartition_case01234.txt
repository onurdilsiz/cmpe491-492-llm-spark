    {
      "operation": "df.repartition(10)  # Inefficient repartitioning",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation in this case is unnecessary and can be replaced with `coalesce()` because it only aims to reduce the number of partitions from the default to 10. `coalesce()` can achieve the same goal without performing a full shuffle, which improves efficiency.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "df.coalesce(10)",
      "benefits": "Replacing `repartition()` with `coalesce()` in this case will avoid unnecessary shuffling, leading to improved resource usage and faster job runtime."
