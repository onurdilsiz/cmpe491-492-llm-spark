    {
      "rddOperation": "repartition() instead of coalesce()",
      "improvementExplanation": "Repartitioning the DataFrame unnecessarily causes a full shuffle, which can be avoided by using coalesce() instead. Coalesce() only shuffles data when necessary, reducing processing time and resource usage.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\ncoalesced_df = sales_df.coalesce(10)\nprint(\"Number of partitions after coalesce:\", coalesced_df.rdd.getNumPartitions())\n```",
      "benefits": "Using coalesce() instead of repartition() can significantly improve performance by avoiding unnecessary shuffles. This leads to faster processing times and reduced resource consumption."

    {
      "rddOperation": "Saving data in CSV format",
      "improvementExplanation": "Saving data in CSV format is less efficient than using a columnar format like Parquet. Parquet provides better compression, faster read/write speeds, and optimized query performance.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\nelectronics_df.write.format(\"parquet\").option(\"header\", \"true\").save(\"path/to/electronics_sales_output.parquet\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet format can significantly improve performance by reducing file size, enabling faster data access, and optimizing query execution."
