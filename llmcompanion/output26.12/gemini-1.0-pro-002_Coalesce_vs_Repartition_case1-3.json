            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame to 200. This is done before writing the DataFrame to a CSV file. However, since the DataFrame is already being written to a file, the shuffle operation performed by `repartition()` is unnecessary. Instead, we can use `coalesce()` to reduce the number of partitions to the desired number (200) without shuffling the data. This will improve the efficiency of the operation by reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred across the network.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df2.coalesce(200).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/repartition/200\")",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` in this case will provide the following benefits:\n- Reduced shuffling: Since the data is already being written to a file, there is no need to shuffle it again. This will save time and resources.\n- Improved resource usage: By reducing the number of partitions, we can reduce the amount of memory and CPU resources used by the operation.\n- Faster runtime: The overall runtime of the operation will be faster because there is less data to shuffle."
