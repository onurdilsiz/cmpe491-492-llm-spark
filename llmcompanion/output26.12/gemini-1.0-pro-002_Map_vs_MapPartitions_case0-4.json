            "operation": "rdd.map(lambda x: (x[0],x[1],x[2],state_convert(x[3]))).collect()",
            "improvementExplanation": "The current map() operation iterates over each element in the RDD individually, applying the `state_convert` function to the state code. This involves repeated function calls and potentially inefficient I/O operations for accessing the broadcast variable. By using `mapPartitions()`, we can process data in batches at the partition level, reducing function call overhead and potentially optimizing I/O for accessing the broadcast variable.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\nresult = rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: (\n    (record[0], record[1], record[2], state_convert(record[3]))\n    for record in partition\n)).collect()\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to `mapPartitions()` offers several benefits:\n\n* **Reduced function call overhead:** By processing data in batches, we avoid calling `state_convert` for each individual element, reducing the number of function calls and improving performance.\n* **Optimized I/O:** Accessing the broadcast variable within `mapPartitions()` can potentially be optimized for batch access, reducing I/O overhead compared to individual element access in `map()`.\n* **Improved resource utilization:** Processing data in batches can lead to better CPU and memory utilization, as data is processed more efficiently."
