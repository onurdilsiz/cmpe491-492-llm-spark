            "operation": "getForm function",
            "improvementExplanation": "The UDF 'getForm' is used to process each link in the partition and perform operations like opening a file, downloading content, and storing it in HDFS. This UDF can be replaced with Spark's native operations like mapPartitions or foreachPartition with built-in functions to avoid the need for custom UDFs.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "forms = spark.textFile('hdfs:///user/carrdp/FinanceML/13F/Q12015/links10.txt') \
        .repartition(10) \
        .foreachPartition(lambda links: \
            [ \
                (link.split('/')[-1], urllib2.urlopen(link).read()) \
                for link in links \
            ] \
        .foreach(lambda x: \
            call(['hadoop', 'fs', '-put', x[0], '/user/carrdp/FinanceML/13F/log/' + x[0]) if x[1] is not None else call(['hadoop', 'fs', '-put', x[0], '/user/carrdp/FinanceML/13F/log/__' + x[0])])",
            "benefits": "By replacing the UDF with native Spark operations, the code can leverage Catalyst optimizations for better query planning and execution. This can lead to improved performance, reduced serialization overhead, and better integration with Spark's distributed computing capabilities."
