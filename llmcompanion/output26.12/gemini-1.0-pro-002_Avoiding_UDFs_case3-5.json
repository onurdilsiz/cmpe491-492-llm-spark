            "operation": "haversine function (line 12)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The haversine function can be replaced with Spark's built-in `distance` function, which calculates the great-circle distance between two points on the Earth. This avoids the need for a custom UDF and leverages Spark's optimized distance calculations.",

            "improvementExplanation": "The gaussian_kernel function can be replaced with Spark's built-in `exp` function and arithmetic operations. This avoids the need for a custom UDF and leverages Spark's optimized mathematical functions.",
