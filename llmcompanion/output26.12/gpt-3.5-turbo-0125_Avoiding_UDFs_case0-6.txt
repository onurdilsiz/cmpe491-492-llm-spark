            "operation": "rdd.flatMap(lambda x: x.split(\" \"))",
            "improvementExplanation": "The lambda function used in flatMap to split each element by space can be replaced with the native DataFrame operation explode() to achieve the same result more efficiently.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "rdd2 = rdd.withColumn('words', F.explode(F.split('value', ' '))).select('words')",
            "benefits": "By using the explode() function along with split() within a DataFrame operation, Spark can optimize the execution plan better, leading to potential performance improvements and reduced serialization overhead."
