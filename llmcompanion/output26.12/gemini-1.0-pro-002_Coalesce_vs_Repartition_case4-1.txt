```json
{
  "detected": false,
  "occurrences": 0,
  "response": []
}
```

**Explanation:**

After analyzing the provided Spark code, I did not detect any instances where `repartition()` is being used. Therefore, the `occurrences` field is set to 0, and the `response` array is empty.

The code primarily focuses on making a REST API request using the `requests` library and processing the response using Spark DataFrames. It does not involve any data transformations or operations that would necessitate the use of `repartition()` or `coalesce()`.

If you encounter scenarios where `repartition()` is used in your Spark code, feel free to provide the relevant code snippets, and I will be happy to analyze them and suggest potential optimizations using `coalesce()`.
