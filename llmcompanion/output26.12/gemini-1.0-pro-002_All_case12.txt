      "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame. However, in this case, we are reducing the number of partitions from the default to 10. This will unnecessarily shuffle the data, which can be avoided by using coalesce() instead.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "coalesced_df = sales_df.coalesce(10)",

      "improvementExplanation": "The map() transformation is used to apply a function to each element of the RDD. However, in this case, the function is simply multiplying each amount by 0.9. This can be done more efficiently using mapPartitions(), which allows us to process the data in batches.",
