      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition(1)` operation is used to create a single partition in the DataFrame. However, since the DataFrame is already being written to S3 in a partitioned manner, using `coalesce(1)` instead would achieve the same result without incurring the overhead of a full shuffle. This is because `coalesce()` only merges partitions when necessary, while `repartition()` always shuffles the data to create the desired number of partitions.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "azureAuditLog_df_dynf = DynamicFrame.fromDF(azureAuditLog_df, glueContext, \"dynamic_frame\").coalesce(1)",
      "benefits": "Replacing `repartition(1)` with `coalesce(1)` will: \n- Reduce shuffling, leading to faster job execution.\n- Improve resource utilization by avoiding unnecessary data movement.\n- Potentially decrease the cost of the job by reducing the amount of data processed."
