      "improvementExplanation": "The UDF `new_salary` simply adds two columns, `salary` and `bonus`. This can be achieved using the built-in function `+` or the native DataFrame/Dataset operation `withColumn`. Replacing the UDF with these alternatives would enable Catalyst optimizations, improve performance, and reduce serialization overhead.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "```python\ndf = df.withColumn('new_salary', df.salary + df.bonus)\n```",
      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with a built-in function or native operation offers several benefits:\n- **Catalyst Optimizations:** Spark's Catalyst optimizer can effectively optimize expressions involving built-in functions and native operations, leading to improved query performance.\n- **Performance Improvement:** Built-in functions and native operations are generally more efficient than UDFs, as they are implemented in Scala and compiled to native code.\n- **Reduced Serialization Overhead:** UDFs require serialization and deserialization during execution, which can add overhead. Using built-in functions or native operations avoids this overhead."

      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the previous case, the UDF `new_salary` simply adds two columns. It can be replaced with the built-in function `+` or the native DataFrame/Dataset operation `withColumn`. This replacement would provide the same benefits as mentioned earlier.",
