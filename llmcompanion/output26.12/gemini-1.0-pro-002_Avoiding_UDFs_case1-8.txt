```json
{
  "detected": false,
  "occurrences": 0,
  "response": []
}
```

**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of User-Defined Functions (UDFs). Therefore, the response object is empty, indicating that no UDFs were detected.

**Benefits of Avoiding UDFs:**

While UDFs can be useful in certain scenarios, they can also introduce performance overhead and hinder Catalyst optimizations. By avoiding UDFs and utilizing Spark's built-in functions and native DataFrame/Dataset operations, you can achieve the following benefits:

- **Improved Performance:** Built-in functions and native operations are often optimized for performance, leading to faster execution times.
- **Catalyst Optimizations:** Spark's Catalyst optimizer can effectively optimize queries that use built-in functions and native operations, resulting in more efficient execution plans.
- **Reduced Serialization Overhead:** UDFs require serialization and deserialization, which can add overhead to data processing. Using built-in functions and native operations avoids this overhead.

**Conclusion:**

In the provided Spark code, there are no UDFs to replace. However, it's essential to understand the benefits of avoiding UDFs whenever possible to optimize performance and leverage Catalyst optimizations.
