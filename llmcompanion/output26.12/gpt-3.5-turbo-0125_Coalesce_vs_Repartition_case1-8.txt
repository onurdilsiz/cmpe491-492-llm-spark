            "operation": "train_repartition_df, val_repartition_df, test_repartition_df = (airbnb_df.repartition(24).randomSplit([.7, .15, .15], seed=42))",
            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(24) operation is used to increase the number of partitions to 24 before performing the randomSplit operation. However, in this case, the repartition() operation is not necessary as it results in a full shuffle of the data, which can be inefficient.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "train_repartition_df, val_repartition_df, test_repartition_df = (airbnb_df.coalesce(24).randomSplit([.7, .15, .15], seed=42))",
            "benefits": "By replacing repartition() with coalesce(), the shuffle operation can be avoided, leading to improved resource usage, reduced shuffling overhead, and potentially faster job runtime."
