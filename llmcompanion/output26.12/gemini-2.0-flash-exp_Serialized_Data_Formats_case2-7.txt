      "operation": "Reading data from text file using sc.textFile(dataset, 40) at line 30",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code currently reads data from a text file, which is inefficient for large datasets. Text files are not optimized for columnar storage, compression, or predicate pushdown. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance, reduce storage space, and enable query optimization.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Assuming the data is already converted to Parquet format and stored in 'data.parquet'\ndata = spark.read.parquet('data.parquet')\nA = data.rdd.map(lambda row: [float(n) for n in row]).cache()\n```\nNote: This assumes that the data has been pre-processed and saved as a parquet file. The original text file needs to be converted to parquet format using spark.write.parquet() before running this code.",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC offers several benefits:\n1. **Faster Reads:** Columnar storage allows Spark to read only the necessary columns, reducing I/O overhead.\n2. **Compression:** Parquet and ORC support efficient compression algorithms, reducing storage space and I/O time.\n3. **Predicate Pushdown:** These formats allow Spark to push down filters to the data source, reducing the amount of data that needs to be read and processed.\n4. **Schema Evolution:** Parquet and ORC support schema evolution, making it easier to handle changes in data structure over time."
