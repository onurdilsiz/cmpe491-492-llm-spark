            "operation": "repartitioned_df.repartition(10)",
            "improvementExplanation": "In this case, repartition(10) is used to increase the number of partitions to 10, which can be inefficient as it causes a full shuffle. Since the goal is to reduce the number of partitions, coalesce() can be used instead.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "coalesced_df = filtered_transactions_df.coalesce(5)",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() with a lower number of partitions (e.g., 5) will reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and potentially lead to faster job runtime."
