            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame from its original number to 10. However, this operation involves a full shuffle, which can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. In this case, since we are only filtering the DataFrame based on the `category` column, we can achieve the same result by using `coalesce()` instead. `coalesce()` reduces the number of partitions without shuffling the data, making it more efficient for this scenario.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "electronics_df = sales_df.filter(sales_df[\"category\"] == \"Electronics\").coalesce(10)",
            "benefits": "Replacing `repartition()` with `coalesce()` in this case offers several benefits:\n\n* **Reduced shuffling:** `coalesce()` avoids the full shuffle required by `repartition()`, leading to faster execution times.\n* **Improved resource usage:** By reducing the number of partitions, `coalesce()` can help optimize resource utilization, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n* **Faster job runtime:** The overall job runtime can be significantly improved by eliminating unnecessary shuffling."
