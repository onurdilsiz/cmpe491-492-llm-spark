    {
      "operation": "Reading text data from HDFS using `spark.read.text()` at line 14.",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a text file, which is not an efficient format for Spark processing.  Text files lack schema information, leading to increased processing overhead.  Switching to Parquet or ORC provides schema enforcement, better compression, and enables predicate pushdown for faster query execution.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\ndf1 = spark.read.parquet(\"hdfs://namenode/user/controller/ncdc-orig/2000-2018.parquet\")\n```\n\nNote: This assumes the data has been pre-processed and saved as a Parquet file.  A schema definition might be needed during the Parquet file creation.",
      "benefits": "Faster read speeds, better compression (reducing storage costs and network transfer times), and improved query performance due to schema enforcement and predicate pushdown."

      "operation": "Writing data to CSV in HDFS using `df_5years.repartition(50).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").mode(\"overwrite\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000-2005/repartition/50\")` at lines 46-48.",
      "improvementExplanation": "Writing to CSV is inefficient for large datasets.  While LZ4 compression is used, Parquet or ORC offer significantly better compression and faster read/write performance.  These formats also support schema enforcement, enabling better data integrity and query optimization.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\ndf_5years.repartition(50).write.parquet(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000-2005/repartition/50\", mode=\"overwrite\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Faster write speeds, significantly better compression (reducing storage costs and network transfer times), and faster read speeds during subsequent processing.  Schema enforcement improves data integrity."
