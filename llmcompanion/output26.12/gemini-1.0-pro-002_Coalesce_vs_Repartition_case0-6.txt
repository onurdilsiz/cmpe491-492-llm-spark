**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of `repartition()`. Therefore, there are no occurrences to analyze and no suggestions for replacing `repartition()` with `coalesce()`. The code primarily focuses on creating an RDD from a list of strings, splitting the strings into words using `flatMap()`, and then collecting and printing the results. 

If you encounter `repartition()` in your Spark code, feel free to provide it, and I'll be happy to analyze it and suggest potential optimizations using `coalesce()`.
