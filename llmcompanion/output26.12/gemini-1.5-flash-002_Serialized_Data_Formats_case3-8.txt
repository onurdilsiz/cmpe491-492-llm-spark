      "operation": "Writing the trained weights to a CSV file using pandas.  Location: Line 181: `pd.DataFrame(result).to_csv(\"rbmWeights.csv\", header=None, index=None)`",
      "improvementExplanation": "Currently, the trained weights are written to a CSV file, which is a text-based format.  CSV is inefficient for storing numerical data in a distributed computing environment like Spark because it lacks features like compression and columnar storage.  Switching to a columnar storage format like Parquet or ORC significantly improves performance, especially for large datasets. Parquet and ORC offer better compression, enabling faster data transfer and reduced storage costs.  They also support predicate pushdown, allowing Spark to filter data before reading it, leading to faster query execution.  Furthermore, their columnar storage allows Spark to read only the necessary columns, improving query performance.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"RBM\").getOrCreate()\nweights_df = spark.createDataFrame(pd.DataFrame(result))\nweights_df.write.parquet(\"rbmWeights.parquet\")",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet offers several key benefits:\n\n* **Faster Writes:** Parquet's efficient encoding and compression lead to faster write operations compared to CSV.\n* **Faster Reads:** Parquet's columnar storage allows Spark to read only the necessary columns, resulting in significantly faster read speeds, especially for large datasets.\n* **Compression:** Parquet provides built-in compression, reducing storage space and improving I/O performance.\n* **Predicate Pushdown:** Parquet supports predicate pushdown, enabling Spark to filter data before reading it, further enhancing query performance.\n* **Schema Enforcement:** Parquet enforces schema, improving data integrity and reducing the risk of errors."
