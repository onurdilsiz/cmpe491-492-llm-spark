```json
{
  "detected": false,
  "occurrences": 0,
  "response": []
}
```

**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of User-Defined Functions (UDFs). Therefore, the response indicates that no UDFs were detected and provides an empty array for the "response" field.

**Benefits of Avoiding UDFs:**

While the provided code does not use UDFs, it's important to highlight the benefits of avoiding them in general:

* **Catalyst Optimizations:** UDFs prevent Catalyst, Spark's query optimizer, from optimizing queries effectively. Built-in functions and native DataFrame/Dataset operations are optimized by Catalyst, leading to better performance.
* **Performance Improvement:** UDFs introduce serialization overhead, as they need to be serialized and sent to executors for execution. Built-in functions and native operations are already available on executors, eliminating this overhead.
* **Reduced Code Complexity:** UDFs add complexity to the code, making it harder to understand and maintain. Using built-in functions and native operations keeps the code concise and easier to manage.

**Additional Notes:**

* The code does contain some inefficient practices, such as using RDDs instead of DataFrames/Datasets and using `map()` instead of `mapPartitions()`. These practices can be improved by using the appropriate DataFrame/Dataset operations.
* The code also uses `repartition()` instead of `coalesce()`. While `repartition()` is not inherently inefficient, it's important to use it judiciously, as it can increase the number of partitions and potentially impact performance.
