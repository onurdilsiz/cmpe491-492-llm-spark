    {
      "operation": "repartitioned_df = sales_df.repartition(10)  # Unnecessary shuffle when reducing partitions",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions from the default to 10. However, since the goal is to reduce the number of partitions, using `coalesce()` would be more efficient as it avoids unnecessary shuffling of data. Shuffling data across the cluster can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially when reducing partitions.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "coalesced_df = sales_df.coalesce(5)  # Reduce partitions without shuffling",
      "benefits": "Replacing `repartition()` with `coalesce()` in this case would:\n- **Reduce shuffling:** Avoids unnecessary data movement across the cluster, leading to faster job execution.\n- **Improve resource usage:** Minimizes network and computational overhead associated with shuffling.\n- **Optimize runtime:** Reduces overall job execution time by eliminating unnecessary shuffling."
