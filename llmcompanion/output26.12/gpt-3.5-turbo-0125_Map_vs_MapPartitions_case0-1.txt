            "improvementExplanation": "The map() transformation is used to split each line of data and convert it into a tuple of user ID, movie ID, and rating. This operation can be performed at the partition level using mapPartitions() to reduce function call overhead and improve efficiency, especially for I/O-heavy operations.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "ratings = data.mapPartitions(lambda partition: ([(int(l[0]), (int(l[1]), float(l[2])) for l in partition]))",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() can optimize I/O operations by processing data in batches at the partition level, reducing the overhead of function calls and improving performance for large datasets."
