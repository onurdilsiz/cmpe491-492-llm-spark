      "operation": "Reading data from a text file using RDD (line 6)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Reading data from a text file using RDD is inefficient. It involves parsing each line individually, which can be slow. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC would allow Spark to read the data much faster, as it can read the data in parallel and avoid parsing each line.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read data from Parquet file\nsales_df = spark.read.parquet(\"path/to/sales.parquet\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Reading data from Parquet or ORC is faster than reading from a text file. It also allows for compression, which can reduce storage space and network transfer time."
    },
    {
      "operation": "Writing data to a DataFrame using repartition (line 17)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Repartitioning the DataFrame before writing to an output is unnecessary and can actually slow down the process. It involves shuffling the data across nodes, which can be time-consuming. Instead, using coalesce() would combine partitions without shuffling, which is more efficient.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Coalesce the DataFrame before writing to an output\ncoalesced_df = electronics_sales_df.coalesce(1)\n```",
      "benefits": "Using coalesce() instead of repartition() can improve the performance of writing data to an output."
