            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition(1)` operation forces a full shuffle of the data across the network to consolidate all data into a single partition. Since the goal is to reduce the number of partitions to 1 for writing a single output file, `coalesce(1)` can be used instead. `coalesce` avoids a full shuffle if the number of partitions is being reduced, making it more efficient.",

            "benefits": "Using `coalesce(1)` instead of `repartition(1)` reduces shuffling, which improves resource usage and job runtime. It avoids a full shuffle of the data, making the operation faster and more efficient."

            "improvementExplanation": "The code writes the output in CSV format, which is not optimized for performance. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve read/write speeds, reduce storage space, and enable query optimizations like predicate pushdown.",
