      "improvementExplanation": "The `map()` transformation is used to apply a discount to each sale record individually. This operation can be optimized by using `mapPartitions()` because the discount calculation is independent for each record and can be applied to a batch of records within a partition. `mapPartitions()` reduces the function call overhead by applying the transformation function once per partition instead of once per record. This is particularly beneficial when the transformation function is computationally expensive or involves I/O operations.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "discounted_sales_rdd = sales_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: [(row[\"sale_id\"], row[\"category\"], row[\"amount\"] * 0.9) for row in partition])",
      "benefits": "Switching to `mapPartitions()` reduces function call overhead, as the lambda function is called once per partition instead of once per record. This can lead to significant performance improvements, especially when dealing with large datasets and computationally intensive transformations. It also allows for potential optimizations within the partition, such as batch processing or shared resource initialization."
