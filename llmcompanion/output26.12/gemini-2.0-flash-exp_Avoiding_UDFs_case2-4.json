            "improvementExplanation": "The UDF `check_prem_typ_desc` is used to transform the 17th element (index 16) of each row. This UDF checks the length of the input string and returns a fixed string based on whether the input is empty or not. This logic can be implemented using Spark's built-in `when` and `otherwise` functions along with `length` function, avoiding the overhead of UDF serialization and execution.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "from pyspark.sql.functions import when, lit, length\n\n# Assuming lines is an RDD of lists\ndf = lines.toDF()\ndf = df.withColumn(\"prem_typ_desc_result\", when(length(df[\"_16\"]) == 0, lit('NULL\\tNULL\\tNULL')).otherwise(lit('TEXT\\tPREMISES\\tVALID')))\nresults = df.select(\"prem_typ_desc_result\").rdd.map(lambda row: row[0])",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with built-in functions allows Spark's Catalyst optimizer to optimize the execution plan. This can lead to significant performance improvements, especially for large datasets. Additionally, it avoids the serialization overhead associated with UDFs, as the logic is executed within the Spark engine itself."
