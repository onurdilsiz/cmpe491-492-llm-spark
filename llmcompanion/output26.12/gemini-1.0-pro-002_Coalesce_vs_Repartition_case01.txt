      "operation": "repartitioned_df = electronics_sales_df.repartition(10)  # Unnecessary shuffling across nodes",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame to 10. However, since the DataFrame is being written to an output file, it is not necessary to increase the number of partitions. Instead, we can use `coalesce()` to reduce the number of partitions to the minimum required for the output format. This will avoid unnecessary shuffling of data across nodes, which can improve performance.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "coalesced_df = electronics_sales_df.coalesce(1)",
      "benefits": "Using `coalesce()` instead of `repartition()` in this case will:\n- Reduce shuffling of data across nodes, leading to faster job execution.\n- Improve resource utilization by reducing the number of partitions.\n- Avoid unnecessary data movement, which can be beneficial for large datasets."
