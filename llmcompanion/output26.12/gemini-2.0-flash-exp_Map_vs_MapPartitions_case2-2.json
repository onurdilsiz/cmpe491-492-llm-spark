            "improvementExplanation": "The `mapPartitions` transformation is used to initialize the data. This is already an efficient operation as it processes data at the partition level. There is no `map` operation to replace here. The `mapPartitions` function `initializeData` reads binary files and converts them to numpy arrays. This is an I/O-bound operation, and `mapPartitions` is the correct choice here as it avoids the overhead of calling a function for each record. If `map` was used, each file would be read individually, which would be less efficient.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "The code is already using `mapPartitions` correctly, so no change is needed.",
            "benefits": "The code is already optimized for this operation. Using `mapPartitions` reduces function call overhead and optimizes I/O by processing data in batches (partitions)."
