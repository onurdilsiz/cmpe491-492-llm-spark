      "improvementExplanation": "The current code reads data from a Delta format file. While Delta format offers advantages like ACID transactions and versioning, it may not be the most efficient format for reading large datasets due to its overhead. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve read performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Load the data from Parquet format\nairbnb_df = spark.read.format(\"parquet\").load(f\"{absolute_dir_path}/imputed_results\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC format can provide the following benefits:\n* **Faster reads:** Parquet and ORC are columnar formats that store data in a compressed and organized manner, allowing for faster data access compared to Delta format.\n* **Compression:** Parquet and ORC offer efficient compression algorithms that can significantly reduce the storage footprint of the data.\n* **Query optimization:** Parquet and ORC support predicate pushdown, which allows Spark to filter data at the file level, further improving query performance."

While Delta format is suitable for write-intensive workloads, it may not be the most efficient format for storing large datasets due to its overhead.
