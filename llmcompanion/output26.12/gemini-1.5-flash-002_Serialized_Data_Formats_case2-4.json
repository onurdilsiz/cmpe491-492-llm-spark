            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a CSV file, which is a text-based format.  CSV files are not optimized for storage or processing in distributed systems like Spark.  Switching to a columnar storage format like Parquet or ORC significantly improves performance by enabling efficient data access and compression. Parquet and ORC support predicate pushdown, allowing Spark to filter data before reading it entirely, reducing I/O operations.",
