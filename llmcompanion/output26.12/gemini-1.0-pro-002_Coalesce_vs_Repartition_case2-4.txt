```json
{
  "detected": false,
  "occurrences": 0,
  "response": []
}
```

## Analysis of Spark Code

The provided Spark code snippet does not contain any instances of `repartition()` or `coalesce()`. Therefore, the `detected` field in the JSON response is set to `false`, and the `occurrences` field is set to `0`. 

## Explanation

The code performs the following tasks:

1. Reads a CSV file using `sc.textFile()`.
2. Maps each line to a list of values using `mapPartitions()` and `reader()`.
3. Filters out the header row using `filter()`.
4. Applies a custom function `check_prem_typ_desc()` to the 17th element of each record using `map()`.
5. Saves the results to a text file using `saveAsTextFile()`.

## Conclusion

Since there are no instances of `repartition()` or `coalesce()` in the code, there is no opportunity to suggest improvements or replacements.
