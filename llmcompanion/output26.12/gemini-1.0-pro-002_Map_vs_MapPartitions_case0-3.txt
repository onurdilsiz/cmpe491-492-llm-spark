**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of `map()` transformations. Therefore, there are no opportunities to replace them with `mapPartitions()` for improved efficiency.

**Additional Notes:**

* The code primarily focuses on demonstrating various aggregation, collection, and statistical operations using Spark RDDs.
* While `mapPartitions()` can offer performance benefits in certain scenarios, it's essential to carefully evaluate the specific use case and data characteristics before making the switch.
* In general, `mapPartitions()` is more suitable for operations that involve batching, I/O-heavy tasks, or custom logic that requires access to the entire partition at once.
