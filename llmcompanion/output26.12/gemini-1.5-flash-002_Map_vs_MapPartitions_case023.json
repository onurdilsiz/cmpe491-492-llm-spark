This is an I/O-bound operation where the overhead of calling the lambda function for each line individually is significant. mapPartitions can process multiple lines within a partition at once, reducing the function call overhead and improving efficiency.",

            "improvementExplanation": "This map operation calculates tax on each order amount. While not strictly I/O bound, the overhead of calling the lambda function for each order is noticeable, especially with a large dataset.  mapPartitions can batch this calculation, reducing the function call overhead and potentially improving performance.",
