            "operation": "df = df.withColumn(\"synthetic_entity_linking\", synthetic_page_skeleton_and_paragraphs_udf(\"page_bytearray\"))",
            "improvementExplanation": "In this case, the map() transformation is used to apply a UDF to each row of the DataFrame. By replacing map() with mapPartitions(), the UDF can be applied at the partition level, reducing the overhead of function calls and improving performance for partition-level operations.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "df = df.rdd.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: [(row[0], row[1], row[2], row[3], synthetic_page_skeleton_and_paragraphs_udf(row[4])) for row in iterator]).toDF()",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() can lead to reduced function call overhead, optimized I/O operations, and improved resource utilization by processing data at the partition level."
