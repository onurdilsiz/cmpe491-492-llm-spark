**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not perform any input/output operations. It only creates an RDD from a list of strings, performs a flatMap operation to split the strings into words, and then prints the words. Therefore, there are no opportunities to optimize input/output operations by switching to serialized data formats like Parquet or ORC.
