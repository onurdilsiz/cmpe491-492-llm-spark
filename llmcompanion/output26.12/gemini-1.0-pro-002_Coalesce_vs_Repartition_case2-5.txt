    {
      "operation": "termDocMatrix.cache()",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `cache()` operation persists the `termDocMatrix` in memory, making subsequent operations faster. However, it also increases memory usage. If memory is a constraint, you can consider using `persist()` instead, which allows you to specify the storage level (e.g., `MEMORY_ONLY`, `DISK_ONLY`, or `MEMORY_AND_DISK`).",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "termDocMatrix.persist(StorageLevel.MEMORY_ONLY)",
      "benefits": "Using `persist()` with `MEMORY_ONLY` storage level provides the following benefits:\n- Faster access to the data for subsequent operations.\n- Reduced memory footprint compared to `cache()`.\n- More control over memory management."
