**Explanation:**

The provided code snippet does not contain any RDD operations. It consists of user-defined functions (UDFs) written in PySpark. UDFs are typically used to perform custom transformations or calculations on individual data elements within a DataFrame or Dataset. They do not involve the creation or manipulation of RDDs directly.

Therefore, there are no opportunities to replace RDDs with DataFrames/Datasets for improved performance in this specific code. The UDFs can be applied directly to DataFrames or Datasets without any modifications.
