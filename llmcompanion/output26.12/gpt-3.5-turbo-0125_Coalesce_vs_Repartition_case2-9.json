            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used to increase the number of partitions for the RDD created from reading the text file. However, in this case, since the data is read from a file and immediately repartitioned, it can be more efficient to use coalesce() instead of repartition(). Coalesce() can reduce the number of partitions without performing a full shuffle, which can be more efficient when decreasing the number of partitions.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "rawData = sc.textFile(data_path).coalesce(numPartitions=L)",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() can reduce unnecessary shuffling, improve resource usage by avoiding a full shuffle operation, and potentially lead to faster job runtime."
