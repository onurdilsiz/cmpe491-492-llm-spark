            "improvementExplanation": "The map operation splits each line of the input file. This operation is I/O-bound and can be significantly optimized by processing multiple lines within a single partition.  mapPartitions allows processing multiple lines at once, reducing the overhead of repeatedly calling the lambda function for each line.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "parsed_transactions_rdd = transactions_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: [line.split(',') for line in iterator])",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions reduces the function call overhead by processing multiple lines within each partition. This leads to improved performance, especially for large files, by minimizing the interaction between the driver and executors."
