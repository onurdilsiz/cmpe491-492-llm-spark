            "improvementExplanation": "The current map() operation processes each element individually, incurring function call overhead for each element. By using mapPartitions(), we can process elements in batches at the partition level, reducing function call overhead and improving efficiency, especially for I/O-heavy operations.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "mapped_rdd = rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: map(lambda line: int(line.split(\",\")[0]) * 2, partition))",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() can reduce function call overhead, optimize I/O operations by processing elements in batches at the partition level, and improve performance for partition-level transformations."
