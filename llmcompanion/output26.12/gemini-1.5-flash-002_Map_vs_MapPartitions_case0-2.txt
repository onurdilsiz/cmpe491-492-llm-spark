      "operation": "spam_samples = spam_features.map(lambda features:LabeledPoint(1, features))\nnon_spam_samples = non_spam_features.map(lambda features:LabeledPoint(0, features))",
      "improvementExplanation": "These map operations apply a simple transformation to each element.  This transformation is independent across elements and doesn't require inter-element communication or access to the entire partition.  Therefore, mapPartitions can process multiple elements at once within a partition, reducing the overhead of repeatedly calling the lambda function for each element.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "spam_samples = spam_features.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: (LabeledPoint(1, features) for features in iterator))\nnon_spam_samples = non_spam_features.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: (LabeledPoint(0, features) for features in iterator))",
      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions reduces the function call overhead significantly, as the lambda function is called once per partition instead of once per element. This leads to improved performance, especially for large datasets."
    },
    {
      "operation": "predictions = model.predict(test_samples.map(lambda x: x.features))",
      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the previous case, this map operation applies a simple transformation (extracting features) to each element.  The transformation is independent and can be efficiently batched within a partition using mapPartitions.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "predictions = model.predict(test_samples.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: (x.features for x in iterator)))",
      "benefits": "Reduces function call overhead, leading to faster prediction time.  The performance gain is more pronounced with larger partitions."
    },
    {
      "operation": "labels_and_preds = test_samples.map(lambda x: x.label).zip(predictions)",
      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation extracts the label from each element.  While seemingly simple, the operation is independent across elements and benefits from batch processing within a partition.  Combining this with the zip operation, which is also partition-wise, makes mapPartitions a suitable replacement.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "labels_and_preds = test_samples.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: (x.label for x in iterator)).zip(predictions)",
      "benefits": "Reduces function call overhead and improves overall efficiency by processing multiple labels simultaneously within each partition. The zip operation is already partition-aware, so the combined effect is significant."
