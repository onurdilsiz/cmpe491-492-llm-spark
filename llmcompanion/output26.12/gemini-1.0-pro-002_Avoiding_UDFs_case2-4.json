            "operation": "The UDF `check_prem_typ_desc` is used on line 14 to analyze the value of the 17th column (index 16) in each row of the DataFrame.",
            "improvementExplanation": "The UDF `check_prem_typ_desc` can be replaced with a combination of built-in functions and transformations. The logic within the UDF can be achieved using an `if` statement within a `map` transformation. This approach leverages Spark's Catalyst optimizer for efficient query execution.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "```python\nresults = lines.map(lambda x: ('NULL', 'NULL', 'NULL') if len(x[16]) == 0 else ('TEXT', 'PREMISES', 'VALID'))\n```",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with built-in functions and transformations offers several benefits:\n- **Catalyst Optimization:** Spark's Catalyst optimizer can effectively optimize queries that use built-in functions and transformations, leading to improved performance.\n- **Performance Enhancement:** Avoiding UDFs reduces serialization overhead, as UDFs require transferring Python functions across the cluster. This results in faster execution times.\n- **Readability and Maintainability:** Using built-in functions and transformations enhances code readability and maintainability, making it easier to understand and modify the logic."
