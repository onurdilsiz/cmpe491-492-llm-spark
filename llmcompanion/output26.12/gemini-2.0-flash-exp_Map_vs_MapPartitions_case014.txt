      "improvementExplanation": "The `map` operation is used to split each line of the input text file into a list of strings based on the comma delimiter. This operation can be performed more efficiently at the partition level using `mapPartitions`. Instead of applying the split function to each line individually, `mapPartitions` allows us to process all lines within a partition at once. This reduces the overhead of calling the lambda function for each record and can lead to performance improvements, especially when dealing with large datasets.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "parsed_transactions_rdd = transactions_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: [line.split(\",\") for line in partition])",
      "benefits": "Switching to `mapPartitions` reduces the function call overhead because the lambda function is called once per partition instead of once per record. This can lead to significant performance gains, especially when the dataset is large and the function is relatively simple. Additionally, if the processing within the function involves some setup or teardown, `mapPartitions` allows for this to be done once per partition, further optimizing resource utilization."
