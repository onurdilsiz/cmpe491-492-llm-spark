      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a Delta Lake table. While Delta Lake offers many advantages over formats like CSV or JSON,  it might still benefit from further optimization depending on the underlying data storage.  If the data is stored as Delta Lake files on top of Parquet or ORC, no change is needed. However, if the data is stored as Delta Lake files on top of a less efficient format, converting the underlying data to Parquet or ORC would significantly improve performance.  Parquet and ORC offer better compression, columnar storage for faster query processing, and support for predicate pushdown, leading to faster read times and improved query performance.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "If the underlying data format of the Delta Lake table is not already Parquet or ORC:\n\n1. Convert the data to Parquet or ORC:\n   ```python\n   airbnb_df.write.format(\"parquet\").mode(\"overwrite\").save(f\"{absolute_dir_path}/imputed_results_parquet\")\n   ```\n   or\n   ```python\n   airbnb_df.write.format(\"orc\").mode(\"overwrite\").save(f\"{absolute_dir_path}/imputed_results_orc\")\n   ```\n2. Update the read operation to point to the new location:\n   ```python\n   airbnb_df = spark.read.format(\"delta\").load(f\"{absolute_dir_path}/imputed_results_parquet\")\n   ```\n   or\n   ```python\n   airbnb_df = spark.read.format(\"delta\").load(f\"{absolute_dir_path}/imputed_results_orc\")\n   ```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC offers several benefits:\n\n* **Faster read/write speeds:** Columnar storage allows for reading only the necessary columns, reducing I/O operations.\n* **Improved compression:** Parquet and ORC provide better compression ratios than Delta Lake's default format, reducing storage space and improving read times.\n* **Predicate pushdown:**  The query optimizer can push down filters to the storage layer, reducing the amount of data processed.\n* **Better query performance:** Overall, queries will be significantly faster due to the combined effects of columnar storage, compression, and predicate pushdown."
