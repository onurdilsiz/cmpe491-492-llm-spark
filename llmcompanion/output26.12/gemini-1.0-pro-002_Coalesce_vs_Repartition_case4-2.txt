    {
      "operation": "df.repartition(4)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame to 4. This is likely done to improve the parallelism of subsequent operations. However, since the DataFrame is already partitioned by `gender`, we can achieve the same level of parallelism by using `coalesce()` instead. This will avoid a full shuffle and potentially improve performance.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "df.coalesce(4)",
      "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` will reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and potentially lead to a faster runtime."
