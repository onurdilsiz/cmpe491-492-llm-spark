            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the `uri_rdd`. However, since the `uri_rdd` is created from a list of distinct buckets, it already has a partition for each bucket. Therefore, using `coalesce()` instead of `repartition()` would be more efficient as it would simply reduce the number of partitions to the desired number without performing a full shuffle.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "uri_rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(distinct_buckets).coalesce(len(distinct_buckets))",
            "benefits": "Replacing `repartition()` with `coalesce()` in this case would reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and potentially lead to a faster job runtime."
