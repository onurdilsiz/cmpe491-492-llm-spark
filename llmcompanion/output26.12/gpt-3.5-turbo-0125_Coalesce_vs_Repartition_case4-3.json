            "operation": "ns = spark.range(5).repartition(3)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(3) operation is used to increase the number of partitions to 3. However, in this case, reducing the partitions using coalesce(3) would be more efficient as it avoids a full shuffle.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "ns = spark.range(5).coalesce(3)",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce(3) reduces shuffling overhead, optimizes resource usage, and potentially speeds up the job execution."
