            "operation": "movie_rating_counts = movie_counts.reduceByKey(lambda x, y: x + y).repartition(4)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(4) operation is used to increase the number of partitions for better parallelism during the reduceByKey operation. However, since the subsequent operations do not require a full shuffle and only need to reduce the partitions, coalesce(4) can be used for more efficient processing.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "movie_rating_counts = movie_counts.reduceByKey(lambda x, y: x + y).coalesce(4)",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce(4) reduces unnecessary shuffling, optimizes resource usage by reducing the number of partitions, and can potentially lead to faster job execution."
