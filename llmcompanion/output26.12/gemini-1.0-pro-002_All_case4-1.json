            "alternativeEquivalent": "Instead of using a UDF, you can use Spark SQL functions like `http_get` or `http_post` to make REST API calls. For example:\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import http_get\n\nrequest_df = request_df.withColumn(\"response\", http_get(col(\"url\")))\n```",
            "benefits": "Replacing UDFs with Spark SQL functions or native DataFrame/Dataset operations offers several benefits:\n- Enables Catalyst optimizations for improved query performance.\n- Reduces serialization overhead, leading to faster execution.\n- Improves code readability and maintainability."
