      "operation": "1. Using map() Instead of mapPartitions() (Line 10)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `map()` transformation in this case is applied to each individual order record, resulting in element-wise processing. This can be inefficient for large datasets, as it incurs significant function call overhead and potentially suboptimal I/O operations. By using `mapPartitions()`, we can process data in batches at the partition level, reducing function call overhead and potentially improving I/O efficiency.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\nelectronics_orders_rdd = parsed_orders_rdd.filter(lambda order: order[3] == \"Electronics\")\n\ntaxed_orders_rdd = electronics_orders_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: \\\n    [(order[0], order[1], float(order[2]) * 1.1, order[3]) for order in partition])\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to `mapPartitions()` in this case offers several benefits:\n- **Reduced function call overhead:** By processing data in batches, we reduce the number of function calls, leading to improved performance.\n- **Optimized I/O:** Batching data can improve I/O efficiency, especially when dealing with large datasets or data stored on distributed file systems.\n- **Improved resource utilization:** By processing data in parallel at the partition level, we can utilize multiple cores and improve resource utilization."

      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the previous case, the `map()` transformation here is applied to each individual order record, leading to potential inefficiencies. Using `mapPartitions()` can improve performance by processing data in batches at the partition level.",
