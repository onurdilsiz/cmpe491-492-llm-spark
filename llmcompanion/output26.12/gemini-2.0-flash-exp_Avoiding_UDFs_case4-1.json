            "improvementExplanation": "The `executeRestApi` UDF performs an external HTTP request, which is not a typical operation that Spark is designed to handle efficiently. UDFs are black boxes to Spark's Catalyst optimizer, preventing it from applying optimizations. Additionally, UDFs involve serialization and deserialization overhead, which can be costly. In this specific case, the UDF is used to fetch data from an external API. While Spark doesn't have a built-in function to directly perform HTTP requests, the entire operation should be moved outside of Spark's DataFrame transformations. The data should be fetched before creating the DataFrame, or the data should be read from a source that Spark can natively handle (e.g., a file, a database). The UDF is not replaceable with a Spark SQL function or native DataFrame/Dataset operation because it performs an external operation. The best approach is to fetch the data outside of Spark and then load it into a DataFrame.",

            "benefits": "By removing the UDF and fetching the data outside of Spark, we avoid the overhead of serialization and deserialization associated with UDFs. This also allows Spark's Catalyst optimizer to work more effectively on the DataFrame operations. The overall performance will be improved by avoiding the UDF and its associated overhead. Additionally, the code becomes more readable and maintainable by separating the data fetching logic from the Spark transformations."
