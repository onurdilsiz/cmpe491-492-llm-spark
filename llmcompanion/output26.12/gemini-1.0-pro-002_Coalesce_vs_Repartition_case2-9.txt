    {
      "operation": "rawData = sc.textFile(data_path).repartition(numPartitions=L)",
      "improvementExplanation": "This repartition() operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the rawData RDD to L. However, since the subsequent operation is a map() transformation, which preserves the number of partitions, using coalesce() instead of repartition() would achieve the same result without incurring the overhead of a full shuffle. Coalesce() only merges partitions without shuffling data, making it more efficient in this scenario.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "rawData = sc.textFile(data_path).coalesce(numPartitions=L)",
      "benefits": "Replacing repartition() with coalesce() in this case would reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and potentially lead to a faster job runtime."
