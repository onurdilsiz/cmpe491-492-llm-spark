    {
      "operation": "df = df.repartition(100)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame to 100. However, since the subsequent operation is `write_to_protobuf()`, which writes the data to a file, a full shuffle is not required. Instead, we can use `coalesce()` to reduce the number of partitions to a smaller number, such as 10, which will still improve resource usage and reduce the amount of data written to disk.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "df = df.coalesce(10)",
      "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` will reduce the amount of data shuffled, improve resource usage, and potentially lead to a faster job runtime."
