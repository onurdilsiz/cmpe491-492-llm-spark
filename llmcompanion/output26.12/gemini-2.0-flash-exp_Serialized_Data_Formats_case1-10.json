            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads a text file containing links. While this works, text files are not optimized for analytical workloads. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance, especially if only certain columns are needed. However, in this specific case, the file contains URLs, which are not structured data, so the benefits of Parquet or ORC are limited. The main benefit would be if the file was large and we wanted to read it in parallel, which is already being done by Spark. Therefore, no change is needed here.",

            "operation": "Writing to local file: `outfile = open(out, 'w'); outfile.write(file)`",
            "improvementExplanation": "The code downloads data from URLs and writes it to local files. This is an intermediate step before writing to HDFS. Writing to local files is not scalable and can be a bottleneck. Instead of writing to local files, the downloaded data should be directly written to HDFS in a more efficient format like Parquet or ORC if the downloaded data is structured. However, in this case, the downloaded data is likely unstructured HTML or text, so Parquet or ORC are not suitable. The current approach is acceptable given the nature of the data.",

            "improvementExplanation": "The code uses `hadoop fs -put` to write local files to HDFS. This is inefficient because it involves a subprocess call for each file. If the downloaded data was structured, it would be better to write directly to HDFS using Spark's DataFrame API in a format like Parquet or ORC. However, in this case, the downloaded data is likely unstructured HTML or text, so Parquet or ORC are not suitable. The current approach is acceptable given the nature of the data.",
