      "rddOperation": "reduceByKey",
      "location": "Line 14",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `reduceByKey` operation on RDDs can be inefficient for large datasets due to shuffling and data movement. DataFrames/Datasets offer optimized query execution plans and can perform aggregations more efficiently.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import sum\n\ndf = spark.createDataFrame(data, ['word', 'count'])\ndf_aggregated = df.groupBy('word').agg(sum('count').alias('total_count'))\ndf_aggregated.show()\n```",
      "benefits": "Using DataFrames/Datasets for aggregation provides the following benefits:\n- **Query optimization:** DataFrames/Datasets leverage Spark's Catalyst optimizer to generate efficient query plans, reducing unnecessary data shuffling and improving performance.\n- **Reduced shuffling:** DataFrames/Datasets minimize data movement by performing aggregations within partitions, leading to faster execution times.\n- **Better resource usage:** DataFrames/Datasets efficiently utilize cluster resources by avoiding unnecessary data copies and shuffles, resulting in lower memory consumption and faster processing."
