            "improvementExplanation": "The current data format being used is CSV, which is less efficient for big data processing compared to optimized formats like Parquet or ORC. Switching to Parquet or ORC can significantly improve performance by enabling better compression, faster reads/writes, and query optimization through predicate pushdown.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "repartitioned_df.write.format(\"parquet\").save(\"path/to/electronics_transactions_output_parquet\")",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet format offers benefits such as better compression, faster reads/writes, and improved query performance due to predicate pushdown. Parquet is columnar storage optimized for analytics workloads, leading to reduced storage costs and improved processing efficiency."
