            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used to parallelize the distinct_buckets RDD with a number of partitions equal to the length of distinct_buckets. This operation results in a full shuffle of data across the cluster, which can be inefficient when reducing the number of partitions suffices.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "uri_rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(distinct_buckets, numSlices=2)",
            "benefits": "By replacing repartition() with coalesce(), the shuffle operation can be avoided, leading to reduced data movement across the cluster, improved resource utilization, and potentially faster job execution."
