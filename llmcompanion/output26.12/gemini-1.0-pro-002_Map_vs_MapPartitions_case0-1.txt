    {
      "operation": "Map operation on line 22: `ratings = data.map(lambda l: l.split()).map(lambda l: (int(l[0]), (int(l[1]), float(l[2]))))`",
      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation splits each line of the input data and then extracts the user ID, movie ID, and rating. This transformation can be performed more efficiently using mapPartitions() because it allows processing multiple lines at once, reducing the number of function calls and improving I/O performance.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\nratings = data.mapPartitions(lambda partition: (\n    for line in partition:\n        fields = line.split()\n        yield (int(fields[0]), (int(fields[1]), float(fields[2])))\n))\n```",
      "benefits": "Replacing map() with mapPartitions() in this case offers several benefits:\n- **Reduced function call overhead:** Processing multiple lines at once reduces the number of function calls, improving performance.\n- **Optimized I/O:** Reading and processing data in larger chunks improves I/O efficiency.\n- **Improved resource utilization:** By processing data in parallel within partitions, mapPartitions() can utilize multiple cores more effectively."

    {
      "operation": "Map operation on line 34: `moviePairSimilarities = moviePairRatings.mapValues(computeCosineSimilarity).cache()`",
      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation computes the cosine similarity for each pair of movie ratings. This transformation can also benefit from mapPartitions() because it allows calculating similarities for multiple pairs within a partition, reducing function call overhead and improving efficiency.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\nmoviePairSimilarities = moviePairRatings.mapPartitions(lambda partition: (\n    for (moviePair, ratings) in partition:\n        yield (moviePair, computeCosineSimilarity(ratings))\n)).cache()\n```",
      "benefits": "Similar to the previous case, replacing map() with mapPartitions() provides the following benefits:\n- **Reduced function call overhead:** Calculating similarities for multiple pairs within a partition reduces the number of function calls, improving performance.\n- **Improved resource utilization:** By processing data in parallel within partitions, mapPartitions() can utilize multiple cores more effectively."
