    {
      "operation": "repartition(4)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition(4)` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame to 4. This is likely done to improve parallelism and potentially speed up subsequent operations. However, if the DataFrame is already sufficiently partitioned, using `coalesce(4)` instead would achieve the same level of parallelism without incurring the overhead of a full shuffle.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "df.coalesce(4)",
      "benefits": "Replacing `repartition(4)` with `coalesce(4)` would avoid a full shuffle, which can significantly improve performance, especially for large datasets. Additionally, it would reduce resource usage and potentially shorten the job runtime."
