```json
{
  "detected": false,
  "occurrences": 0,
  "response": []
}
```

**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of User-Defined Functions (UDFs). Therefore, the `detected` field is set to `false`, and the `occurrences` field is set to `0`. Consequently, the `response` array is empty.

**Analysis:**

The code demonstrates the use of Spark's built-in functions and DataFrame/Dataset operations for data processing. Specifically, it showcases:

- **`repartition()`:** This function is used to change the number of partitions in a DataFrame. In the given example, it is used to repartition the DataFrame into 10 partitions.
- **`map()`:** This function is used to apply a transformation to each element of a DataFrame. In this case, it is used to calculate a 10% discount for each sale.

**Benefits of Avoiding UDFs:**

- **Catalyst Optimizations:** Spark's Catalyst optimizer can effectively optimize built-in functions and native DataFrame/Dataset operations, leading to improved performance.
- **Performance:** Built-in functions and native operations are generally more efficient than UDFs, as they are implemented in Scala and compiled to native code.
- **Serialization Overhead:** UDFs require serialization and deserialization, which can add overhead to data processing.

**Conclusion:**

The provided Spark code effectively utilizes Spark's built-in functions and DataFrame/Dataset operations for data analysis, avoiding the use of UDFs and their associated drawbacks. This approach enables Catalyst optimizations, improves performance, and reduces serialization overhead.
