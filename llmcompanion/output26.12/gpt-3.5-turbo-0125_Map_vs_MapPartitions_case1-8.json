            "improvementExplanation": "The VectorAssembler transformation is currently applied using map() to concatenate values for each predictor into a vector. This operation can be more efficiently performed at the partition level using mapPartitions() as it involves processing multiple rows at once.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "vec_assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=[\"review_scores_rating\"], outputCol=\"features\")\n\ndef map_partitions_func(iterator):\n    for row in iterator:\n        yield vec_assembler.transform([row])\n\nvec_train_df = train_df.rdd.mapPartitions(map_partitions_func).toDF()",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() can reduce function call overhead by processing multiple rows at once, optimize I/O operations by minimizing the number of transformations, and improve performance for partition-level operations."
