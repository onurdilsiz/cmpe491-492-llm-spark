            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads a text file, which is likely a CSV file based on the file path and subsequent processing. Text files are not optimized for analytical workloads. Reading text files requires parsing each line, which is inefficient. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance by allowing Spark to read only the necessary columns and leverage predicate pushdown.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\ndf1 = spark.read.parquet(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/parquet-file\")\n```\nAssuming the data is already converted to parquet format and stored in `hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/parquet-file`",
            "benefits": "Parquet provides faster reads due to columnar storage, schema evolution, and predicate pushdown. It also offers better compression than text files, reducing storage space and I/O overhead."

            "improvementExplanation": "The code writes the processed data to a CSV file. While compression is used, CSV is still row-based and not ideal for analytical queries. Writing to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would be more efficient for subsequent reads and analysis. Parquet is generally preferred for its better performance and wider support in the Spark ecosystem.",

            "benefits": "Parquet offers faster writes and reads due to columnar storage, schema evolution, and predicate pushdown. It also provides better compression than CSV, even with LZ4 compression, leading to reduced storage space and I/O overhead. Additionally, Parquet is more efficient for analytical queries as it allows Spark to read only the necessary columns."
