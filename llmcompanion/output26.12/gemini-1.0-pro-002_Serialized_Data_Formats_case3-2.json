            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads a CSV file using `spark.read.csv()`. This format is not optimized for Spark and can lead to slower processing times. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve read performance due to columnar storage and compression.",

            "improvementExplanation": "The code writes the filtered data to a CSV file using `filtered_df.write.csv()`. Similar to reading, writing to CSV is not optimized for Spark. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can improve write performance and reduce storage space requirements.",
