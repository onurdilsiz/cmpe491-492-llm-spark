            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to shuffle the data into a specified number of partitions. However, in this case, the `select()` operation only involves a transformation on the existing data without any shuffling. Therefore, using `coalesce()` instead of `repartition()` would be more efficient as it simply reduces the number of partitions without shuffling the data.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df.select(col(\"Seqno\"), \\n    convertUDF(col(\"Name\")).alias(\"Name\") ) \\n.coalesce(4).show(truncate=False)",
            "benefits": "Replacing `repartition()` with `coalesce()` in this case would reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and potentially lead to a faster runtime."
