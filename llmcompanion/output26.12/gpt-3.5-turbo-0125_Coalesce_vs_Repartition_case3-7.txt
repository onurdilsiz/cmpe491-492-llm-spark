            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used to evenly distribute the data across partitions after splitting the data into training and test sets. However, since the data size is not significantly large and the split is not intended for parallel processing, using coalesce() instead of repartition() can avoid unnecessary shuffling.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "train, test = train_test_split(data).coalesce(1)",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce(1) reduces unnecessary shuffling, improves resource usage by avoiding full data redistribution, and potentially speeds up the job runtime."
