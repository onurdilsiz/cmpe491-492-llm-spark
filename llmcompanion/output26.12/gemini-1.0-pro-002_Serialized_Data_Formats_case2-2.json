            "operation": "Reading binary files from HDFS",
            "improvementExplanation": "Reading binary files from HDFS can be inefficient, especially for large datasets. Using a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve read performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred and processed. Additionally, Parquet and ORC support columnar storage, which allows for efficient query optimization.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read data from Parquet file\nparquet_file = sc.read.parquet(inputDir)\n\n# Convert Parquet data to RDD of numpy arrays\nrdd = parquet_file.rdd.map(lambda row: row.asDict())\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC can provide the following benefits:\n\n* **Faster read performance:** Parquet and ORC use columnar storage, which allows for efficient query optimization. This can significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred and processed, leading to faster read times.\n* **Compression:** Parquet and ORC support compression, which can reduce the storage space required for the data. This can be especially beneficial for large datasets.\n* **Query optimization:** Parquet and ORC support predicate pushdown, which allows queries to be executed directly on the compressed data. This can further improve query performance."
