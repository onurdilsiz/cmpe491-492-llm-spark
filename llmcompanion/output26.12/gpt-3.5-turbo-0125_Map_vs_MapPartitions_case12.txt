            "operation": "sales_rdd.map(lambda row: (row[\"sale_id\"], row[\"category\"], row[\"amount\"] * 0.9))",
            "improvementExplanation": "The current map() transformation processes each row individually, incurring function call overhead for each element. By using mapPartitions(), we can perform the discount calculation at the partition level, reducing function call overhead and improving efficiency, especially for I/O-heavy operations.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "discounted_sales_rdd = sales_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: ((row[\"sale_id\"], row[\"category\"], row[\"amount\"] * 0.9) for row in partition))",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() can reduce function call overhead by processing elements in batches at the partition level, leading to optimized I/O operations and improved performance for partition-level transformations."
