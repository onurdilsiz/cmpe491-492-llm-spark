      "improvementExplanation": "In this case, repartition() is used to write the datetime table to a Parquet file. However, since the data is already partitioned by year and month, using coalesce() instead would be more efficient. Coalesce() will simply combine the existing partitions without shuffling the data, resulting in faster write times and reduced resource usage.",
