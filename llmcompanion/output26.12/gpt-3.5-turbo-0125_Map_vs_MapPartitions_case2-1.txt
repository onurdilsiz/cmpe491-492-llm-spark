            "operation": "flat_q3.mapPartitions(is_number)",
            "improvementExplanation": "In the given context, the map() transformation is used to apply the 'is_number' function on each element individually. Since the 'is_number' function operates on each element independently, it can be more efficient to process elements in batches at the partition level using mapPartitions(). This can reduce the overhead of function calls and improve performance, especially for I/O-heavy operations.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "map_q3 = flat_q3.mapPartitions(is_number)",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() can lead to reduced function call overhead by processing elements in batches at the partition level. This can optimize I/O operations and improve performance, particularly for scenarios where processing elements individually incurs unnecessary overhead."
