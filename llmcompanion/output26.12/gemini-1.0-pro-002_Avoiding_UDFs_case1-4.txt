**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of User-Defined Functions (UDFs). All data transformations are performed using built-in Spark SQL functions and native DataFrame/Dataset operations.

**Benefits of Avoiding UDFs:**

* **Catalyst Optimizations:** Built-in functions and native operations are optimized by Catalyst, Spark's query optimizer, resulting in more efficient execution plans.
* **Performance Improvement:** Avoiding UDFs can lead to significant performance improvements, especially for complex transformations.
* **Reduced Serialization Overhead:** UDFs require serialization and deserialization, which can add overhead to data processing.

**Conclusion:**

The provided Spark code effectively utilizes built-in functions and native operations, maximizing performance and efficiency.
