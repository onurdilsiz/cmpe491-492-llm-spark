            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a text file using `spark.sparkContext.textFile()`. This is an inefficient way to read data into Spark, especially for large datasets. Instead, it's recommended to use optimized file formats like Parquet or ORC. These formats provide faster reads, compression, and support for predicate pushdown, which can significantly improve query performance.",

            "improvementExplanation": "The code writes data to a CSV file using `write.format(\"csv\")`. While CSV is a common format, it's not optimized for Spark. Parquet or ORC are better choices for writing data in Spark due to their faster writes, compression, and support for columnar storage.",
