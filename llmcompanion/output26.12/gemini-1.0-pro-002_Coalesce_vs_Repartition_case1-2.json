            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame to 1. However, since the DataFrame is being written to a file, it is not necessary to shuffle the data across all partitions. Instead, we can use `coalesce()` to reduce the number of partitions to 1 without shuffling the data. This will improve the efficiency of the operation by reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred across the network.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df2.coalesce(1).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/repartition/1\")",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` will reduce the amount of data shuffling, improve resource usage, and potentially lead to a faster job runtime."
