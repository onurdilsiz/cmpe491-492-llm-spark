            "operation": "customerDF.filter(customerDF['salary'] > 30000).select('age','country').show()",
            "improvementExplanation": "In this case, the map() transformation is used to filter rows based on a salary condition and then select specific columns. Since these operations can be performed at the partition level without the need to process each row individually, using mapPartitions() can improve efficiency.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "customerDF.rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: (row for row in partition if row['salary'] > 30000)).map(lambda row: (row['age'], row['country'])).toDF(['age', 'country']).show()",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() can reduce the overhead of function calls by processing data at the partition level, leading to optimized I/O operations and improved performance for partition-level operations."
