      "improvementExplanation": "The initial text file is read into an RDD.  The `repartition(10)` operation is used to redistribute the data across 10 partitions. However, since the goal is to distribute the download tasks, and the number of partitions is not inherently tied to data size or processing needs, reducing the number of partitions might be sufficient. If the number of partitions in the initial RDD is greater than 10, `coalesce` can efficiently reduce the number of partitions without a full shuffle, leading to performance gains. If the initial number of partitions is less than or equal to 10, `coalesce` would be a no-op and `repartition` would still be necessary.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "forms = spark.textFile('hdfs:///user/carrdp/FinanceML/13F/Q12015/links10.txt') \\n        .coalesce(10, shuffle=True) \\n        .foreachPartition(getForm)",
      "benefits": "Using `coalesce(10, shuffle=True)` instead of `repartition(10)` can significantly reduce the shuffle time if the initial number of partitions is greater than 10.  This leads to improved resource usage (less network traffic and CPU usage during the shuffle) and a faster job runtime. If the initial number of partitions is less than or equal to 10, there is no performance benefit, but there is also no performance penalty."
