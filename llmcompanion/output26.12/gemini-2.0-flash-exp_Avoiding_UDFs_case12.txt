      "improvementExplanation": "The `map` operation on the RDD is performing an element-wise transformation, which can be inefficient. This can be replaced with a DataFrame operation using `withColumn` and a simple arithmetic expression. Using DataFrame operations allows Spark's Catalyst optimizer to optimize the execution plan, potentially leading to better performance. Additionally, using DataFrame operations avoids the overhead of serializing and deserializing data between Python and the JVM.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "discounted_sales_df = repartitioned_df.withColumn(\"discounted_amount\", repartitioned_df[\"amount\"] * 0.9)\ndiscounted_sales_df = discounted_sales_df.select(\"sale_id\", \"category\", \"discounted_amount\")\nprint(\"Sample discounted sales:\", discounted_sales_df.take(5))",
      "benefits": "Replacing the RDD `map` with DataFrame operations enables Catalyst optimizations, improves performance by avoiding serialization overhead, and allows for more efficient execution planning."
