            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used to increase the number of partitions to the specified value (self.num_workers). However, if the goal is to reduce the number of partitions without a full shuffle, coalesce() can be more efficient.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "rdd = rdd.coalesce(self.num_workers)",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() can reduce unnecessary shuffling, improve resource usage, and potentially lead to faster job runtimes."
