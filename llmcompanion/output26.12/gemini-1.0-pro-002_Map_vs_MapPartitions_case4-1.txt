    {
      "operation": "The map() operation is used on line 34 to transform each element in the 'results' column.",
      "improvementExplanation": "The map() operation iterates over each element in the 'results' column individually, which can be inefficient for large datasets. By using mapPartitions() instead, we can process data in batches, reducing the number of function calls and improving I/O efficiency.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\nrequest_df.select(explode(col('execute.Results')).alias('results')) \\\n    .select(col('results.Make_ID'), col('results.Make_Name')) \\\n    .rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: map(lambda row: (row.Make_ID, row.Make_Name), partition))\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() offers several benefits:\n\n* **Reduced function call overhead:** By processing data in batches, we reduce the number of function calls, leading to improved performance.\n* **Optimized I/O:** mapPartitions() allows for more efficient I/O operations, as data can be read and processed in larger chunks.\n* **Improved resource utilization:** By reducing the number of function calls and optimizing I/O, mapPartitions() can improve resource utilization and overall performance."
