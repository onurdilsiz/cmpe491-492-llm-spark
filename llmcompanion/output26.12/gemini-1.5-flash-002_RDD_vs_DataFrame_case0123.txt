      "improvementExplanation": "These RDD operations are inefficient because they process data element by element.  DataFrames provide optimized execution plans and leverage Catalyst optimizer for better performance.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "from pyspark.sql.functions import col\n\nlog_df = spark.read.csv(\"path/to/logs.txt\", header=False, inferSchema=True)\nerror_logs_df = log_df.filter(col(\"_c1\") == \"ERROR\")\nerror_count = error_logs_df.count()",
      "benefits": "DataFrames offer significant performance improvements due to optimized execution plans and parallel processing.  Catalyst optimizer can push down filters and projections, reducing data shuffling and improving overall efficiency.  Resource usage is also optimized as DataFrames leverage Spark's optimized execution engine."

      "rddOperation": "error_logs_df.repartition(10) (line 18)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Using repartition() unnecessarily increases the number of partitions, leading to increased shuffling and reduced performance.  coalesce() is more efficient when reducing the number of partitions.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "if error_logs_df.rdd.getNumPartitions() > 1:\n    error_logs_df = error_logs_df.coalesce(1)",

      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the first case, this RDD map operation processes data element by element. DataFrames provide optimized columnar processing.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "timestamps_df = error_logs_df.select(\"timestamp\")",
      "benefits": "DataFrames provide optimized columnar processing, which is significantly faster than processing each element individually with RDDs. This leads to better performance and reduced resource consumption."

      "dataframeEquivalent": "repartitioned_df.write.format(\"parquet\").mode(\"overwrite\").save(\"path/to/error_logs_output.parquet\")",
