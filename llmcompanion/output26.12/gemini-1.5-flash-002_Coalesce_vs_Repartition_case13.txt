      "improvementExplanation": "The provided code uses `repartition(10)` to redistribute data across 10 partitions.  Since the initial DataFrame has a small number of partitions (likely only 1 in this local[*] example), and no preceding operations that would necessitate a large number of partitions, this operation causes unnecessary data shuffling.  `coalesce` can reduce the number of partitions without shuffling if the target number of partitions is less than or equal to the current number.  In this case, increasing the number of partitions is likely not beneficial for a small dataset processed locally.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "repartitioned_df = sales_df.coalesce(10)",
      "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce(10)` would avoid a full data shuffle if the initial number of partitions is less than 10. This results in significantly reduced processing time and resource consumption, especially beneficial for larger datasets. If the initial number of partitions is greater than 10, coalesce will still perform better than repartition by avoiding unnecessary shuffling."
