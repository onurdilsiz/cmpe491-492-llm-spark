            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used to increase the number of partitions after the mapPartitionsWithIndex transformation. Since reduceByKey does not require a full shuffle and only needs to merge values within the same key, using coalesce() instead of repartition() can improve efficiency by reducing unnecessary shuffling.",

            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() will reduce shuffling overhead, optimize resource usage, and potentially lead to faster job execution."

            "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the previous case, the repartition() operation is used after mapPartitions to increase the number of partitions. Since reduceByKey does not require a full shuffle, replacing repartition() with coalesce() can enhance performance by avoiding unnecessary data movement.",

            "benefits": "By switching to coalesce(), the job can benefit from reduced shuffling, better resource utilization, and potentially faster completion times."
