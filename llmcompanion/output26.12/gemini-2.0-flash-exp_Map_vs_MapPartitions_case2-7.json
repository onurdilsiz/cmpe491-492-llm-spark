            "improvementExplanation": "The `map` operation here converts each line of text into a list of floats. This operation can be performed more efficiently at the partition level using `mapPartitions`. Instead of applying the lambda function to each line individually, `mapPartitions` will apply it to an iterator of lines within each partition. This reduces the overhead of calling the lambda function for each line and can improve performance, especially if the conversion process is computationally intensive.",

This can significantly reduce the overhead, especially for large datasets. Improved performance: By processing data in batches within each partition, the overall execution time can be reduced."
