      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a text file ('spam.txt').  Text files are not optimized for Spark processing.  They lack schema information, leading to inefficient data parsing and storage. Switching to Parquet or ORC provides schema enforcement, efficient compression, and optimized data layout for faster read/write operations and improved query performance.",
