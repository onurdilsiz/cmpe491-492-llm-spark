            "improvementExplanation": "The pandas UDF `five` is defined to return a constant value of 5. This can be achieved using the `lit` function from `pyspark.sql.functions` which creates a literal column. Using `lit` avoids the overhead of UDF execution and allows Spark to optimize the query. Pandas UDFs are generally more expensive than regular UDFs and should be avoided when possible.",

            "operation": "result_df = df.selectExpr(\"my_custom_scala_fn(id) as id\")",
            "improvementExplanation": "The code uses a custom Scala function `my_custom_scala_fn`. While this is not a Python UDF, it is still an external function call that prevents Spark from fully optimizing the query. If the logic of `my_custom_scala_fn` can be expressed using Spark SQL functions or DataFrame operations, it should be done to improve performance. Without knowing the implementation of `my_custom_scala_fn`, a specific replacement cannot be provided. However, the general principle is to avoid external function calls when possible.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "This cannot be replaced without knowing the implementation of `my_custom_scala_fn`. If it can be expressed using Spark SQL functions, it should be done. For example, if `my_custom_scala_fn` was `id + 1`, the replacement would be `df.selectExpr(\"id + 1 as id\")` or `df.select(df['id'] + 1).alias('id')`",

Using direct column selection avoids the overhead of UDF execution and allows Spark to optimize the query.
