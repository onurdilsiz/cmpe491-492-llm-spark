      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a CSV file.  CSV is a text-based format, leading to slower read times and larger file sizes compared to binary formats like Parquet or ORC.  Switching to Parquet or ORC will significantly improve performance by enabling efficient columnar storage, compression, and predicate pushdown.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "df1 = spark.read.parquet(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/parquet-file\")",
      "benefits": "Faster read speeds, smaller file sizes due to compression, and improved query performance through predicate pushdown and efficient columnar storage."

      "improvementExplanation": "The code writes data to a CSV file. While LZ4 compression is used, Parquet or ORC offer superior compression and performance.  These formats support efficient columnar storage, enabling faster writes and reads, especially for large datasets and complex queries.",

      "benefits": "Faster write speeds, smaller file sizes due to better compression, and improved read performance for subsequent queries.  Parquet's columnar storage allows for efficient processing of specific columns, reducing I/O operations."
