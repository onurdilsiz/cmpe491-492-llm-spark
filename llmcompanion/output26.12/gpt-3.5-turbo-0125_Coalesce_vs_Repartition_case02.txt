            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used here to redistribute the data evenly across partitions after filtering for high salaries. However, since the operation does not require a full shuffle and only aims to reduce the number of partitions, coalesce() can be more efficient.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "high_salary_rdd = parsed_employee_rdd.filter(lambda emp: float(emp[2]) > 50000).coalesce(4)",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() reduces unnecessary shuffling, optimizes resource usage by minimizing data movement, and potentially speeds up the job execution."
