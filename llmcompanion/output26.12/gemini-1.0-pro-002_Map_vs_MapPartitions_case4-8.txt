      "operation": "URLs2domain function (line 32)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The URLs2domain function iterates over a list of URLs and applies the __URL2domain function to each element. This operation involves I/O and can be optimized by using mapPartitions() to process the list in batches, reducing the number of function calls and improving I/O efficiency.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\n@udf(ArrayType(StringType()))\ndef URLs2domain(urls: List[str]) -> List[str]:\n    """Trims a list of URLs and leaves only the root domains."""\n    def process_partition(iterator):\n        for url in iterator:\n            yield __URL2domain(url)\n    return spark.sparkContext.parallelize(urls, numSlices=8).mapPartitions(process_partition).collect()\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() in this case offers the following benefits:\n- Reduced function call overhead: By processing the list in batches, we reduce the number of calls to the __URL2domain function, improving performance.\n- Optimized I/O: Batching the data allows for more efficient I/O operations, as the function is applied to a group of URLs at once.\n- Improved resource utilization: By processing the data in parallel, we can utilize multiple cores and improve resource utilization."
