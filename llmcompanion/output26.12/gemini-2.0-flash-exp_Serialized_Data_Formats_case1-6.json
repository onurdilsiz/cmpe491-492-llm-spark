            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads a text file. Text files are not optimized for analytical workloads. They lack schema information, require parsing, and are not compressed efficiently. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance, especially for large datasets, by enabling predicate pushdown and efficient data skipping.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\ndf1 = spark.read.parquet(\"hdfs://namenode/user/controller/ncdc-orig/2000-2018.parquet\")\n# Assuming the data is already converted to parquet format. If not, you need to convert it once and then read from parquet.\n# Example of converting to parquet:\n# df1 = spark.read.text(\"hdfs://namenode/user/controller/ncdc-orig/2000-2018.txt\")\n# ... (rest of the transformations to create df2)\n# df2.write.parquet(\"hdfs://namenode/user/controller/ncdc-orig/2000-2018.parquet\")\n```",
            "benefits": "Parquet or ORC offer faster reads due to columnar storage, efficient compression, and schema awareness. They also enable predicate pushdown, which reduces the amount of data read from disk, leading to significant performance gains."

            "improvementExplanation": "The code writes data to a CSV file. While CSV is human-readable, it's not optimized for analytical processing. It lacks schema information, requires parsing, and is not as efficient as columnar formats like Parquet or ORC. Switching to Parquet or ORC would improve write performance, reduce storage space, and enable faster reads in subsequent operations.",
