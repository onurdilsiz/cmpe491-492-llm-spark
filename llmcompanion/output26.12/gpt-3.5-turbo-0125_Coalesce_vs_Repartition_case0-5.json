            "operation": "rdd = rdd.repartition(4)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(4) operation is used to increase the number of partitions to 4 for better parallelism. However, in this case, the operation does not require a full shuffle as it only reduces the number of partitions. Hence, coalesce(4) can be used instead.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "rdd = rdd.coalesce(4)",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce(4) reduces unnecessary shuffling, optimizes resource usage, and potentially speeds up the job execution."
