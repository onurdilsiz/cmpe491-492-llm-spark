            "improvementExplanation": "The `collect()` operation on an RDD brings all the data to the driver node, which can be inefficient for large datasets. While it's used here for printing, it's generally better to avoid `collect()` for large datasets. However, in this specific case, the dataset is small, so the performance impact is minimal. Still, we can demonstrate how to achieve the same result using DataFrames.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\ndf = spark.createDataFrame(data, StringType())\ndf.show(truncate=False)\n```",
            "benefits": "While the performance gain in this specific case is minimal due to the small dataset, using DataFrames provides a more structured way to handle data. The `show()` action is optimized for displaying data and is generally preferred over `collect()` for large datasets. It also allows for more complex operations later on using the DataFrame API."

        {
            "rddOperation": "rdd.flatMap(lambda x: x.split(\" \")) (line 18)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `flatMap` operation on an RDD can be replaced with a DataFrame transformation for better performance and optimization. DataFrames allow Spark to perform query optimizations and use more efficient execution plans.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import explode, split\ndf = spark.createDataFrame(data, StringType())\ndf2 = df.select(explode(split(df[\"_1\"], \" \")).alias(\"words\"))\ndf2.show()\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to DataFrames allows Spark to leverage its Catalyst optimizer, which can significantly improve performance. The `explode` and `split` functions are optimized for DataFrame operations. This approach also reduces the need for manual data manipulation using lambda functions, making the code more readable and maintainable. DataFrames also benefit from Tungsten's memory management, which can lead to better resource utilization and reduced shuffling."
