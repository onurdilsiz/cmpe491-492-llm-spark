            "operation": "wc = sc.textFile(word_file).flatMap(lambda line: line.split(' ')).map(lambda word: (word, 1)).reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a + b)",
            "improvementExplanation": "In this case, the map() transformation is used to convert each word into a key-value pair for counting. Since the map() operation is applied to each individual element, it can be more efficient to use mapPartitions() for batching the processing at the partition level.",

            "benefits": "By switching to mapPartitions(), the processing overhead of applying the transformation to each element is reduced, leading to improved performance especially for I/O-heavy operations."
