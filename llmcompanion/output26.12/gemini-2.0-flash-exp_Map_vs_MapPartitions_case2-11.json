            "improvementExplanation": "The `map` operation here is converting each dictionary in the `json_rdd` to a Spark Row object. This is a simple transformation that can be done at the partition level. Instead of applying the `Row` conversion to each element individually, we can apply it to a batch of elements within each partition using `mapPartitions`. This reduces the overhead of calling the lambda function for each element and can improve performance.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "def row_conversion(iterator):\n    for item in iterator:\n        yield Row(**item)\ndf = json_rdd.mapPartitions(row_conversion).toDF()",
            "benefits": "Switching to `mapPartitions` reduces the function call overhead because the `row_conversion` function is called once per partition instead of once per element. This can lead to a significant performance improvement, especially when dealing with large datasets. Additionally, it can improve resource utilization by processing data in batches."
