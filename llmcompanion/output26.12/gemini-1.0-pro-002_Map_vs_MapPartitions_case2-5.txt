      "operation": "map() operation on line 22: map(lambda tc: (tc[0], plainTextToLemmas(tc[1], stopWords, pipeline)), itr)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The map() operation on line 22 iterates over each text chunk (tc) and performs the plainTextToLemmas() function on the text content (tc[1]). This function involves tokenization, sentence splitting, part-of-speech tagging, and lemmatization, which can be computationally expensive. By using mapPartitions() instead, we can process multiple text chunks in a single partition, reducing the number of function calls and improving efficiency.",

      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() offers several benefits:\n- Reduced function call overhead: By processing multiple text chunks in a single partition, we reduce the number of function calls to plainTextToLemmas(), improving performance.\n- Optimized I/O: mapPartitions() allows for more efficient I/O operations, as data can be read and processed in larger chunks.\n- Improved resource utilization: By reducing the number of function calls and optimizing I/O, mapPartitions() can lead to better resource utilization."
