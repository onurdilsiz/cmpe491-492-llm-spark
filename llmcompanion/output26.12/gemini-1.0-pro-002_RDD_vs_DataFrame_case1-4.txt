      "improvementExplanation": "This RDD filter operation can be replaced with a DataFrame filter operation, which is generally more efficient due to Spark's query optimization capabilities.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "df_5years = df2.filter(df2['Observation_Date'].between('2000-01-01', '2005-12-31'))",
      "benefits": "Switching to a DataFrame filter will leverage Spark's Catalyst Optimizer, which can optimize the query plan and reduce the amount of data shuffled across the cluster. This can lead to significant performance improvements, especially for large datasets."
