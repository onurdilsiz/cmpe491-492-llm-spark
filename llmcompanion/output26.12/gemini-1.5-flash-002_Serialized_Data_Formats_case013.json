            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads transaction data from a text file (CSV) using RDDs.  This is inefficient because RDDs are not optimized for structured data processing.  Switching to Parquet or ORC allows for schema enforcement, columnar storage, and efficient compression, leading to faster reads and writes, and better query performance.  The initial data loading should be done directly into a DataFrame using the Spark SQL reader.",

            "improvementExplanation": "The code saves the processed data to a CSV file. CSV is not an efficient format for large datasets.  Parquet or ORC offer significant advantages in terms of storage space, read/write performance, and query optimization.  These formats support compression and columnar storage, enabling faster data access and reduced I/O operations.",

            "benefits": "Smaller file size due to compression, faster read/write speeds, and improved query performance due to columnar storage and predicate pushdown.  Parquet also supports schema evolution."
