            "operation": "as_block_matrix function",
            "improvementExplanation": "The as_block_matrix function is used to convert an RDD to an IndexedRowMatrix and then to a BlockMatrix. This operation can be replaced with native Spark operations like map and toDF to create DataFrames directly without the need for a custom UDF.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "dataDF = spark.createDataFrame(data, ['col1', 'col2', ...])",
            "benefits": "By using native Spark operations instead of UDFs, you can leverage Catalyst optimizations, improve performance by utilizing Spark's internal optimizations, and reduce serialization overhead."
