            "improvementExplanation": "The map() transformation is used to convert each element of the RDD into a Row object, which is then used to create a DataFrame. This operation can be performed more efficiently at the partition level using mapPartitions(). By using mapPartitions(), we can process multiple elements within a partition at once, reducing the overhead of function calls and potentially improving performance for I/O-heavy operations.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "df = json_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda iter: [Row(**x) for x in iter]).toDF()",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() can reduce the overhead of function calls by processing multiple elements in a partition at once. This can lead to optimized I/O operations and improved resource utilization, especially for partition-level transformations."
