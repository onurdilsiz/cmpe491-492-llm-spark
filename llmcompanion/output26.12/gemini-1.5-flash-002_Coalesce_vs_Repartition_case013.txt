      "operation": "repartitioned_df = filtered_transactions_df.repartition(10)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code uses `repartition(10)` to redistribute the data into 10 partitions.  This operation always triggers a full shuffle, regardless of the initial number of partitions. Since the goal is likely not to increase the number of partitions but potentially to adjust it for downstream operations or output, using `coalesce` would be more efficient if the number of partitions is reduced or remains the same. If the number of partitions needs to be increased, `repartition` is necessary.  In this case, if the number of partitions in `filtered_transactions_df` is less than or equal to 10, `coalesce` can replace `repartition` without a full shuffle.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "repartitioned_df = filtered_transactions_df.coalesce(10)",
      "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce(10)` would avoid a full shuffle if the initial number of partitions is less than or equal to 10. This results in reduced data movement, lower resource consumption (CPU, memory, network), and faster job execution time. If the initial number of partitions is greater than 10, `coalesce` will still be more efficient than `repartition` as it avoids a full shuffle and only performs the necessary data movement to reduce the number of partitions."
