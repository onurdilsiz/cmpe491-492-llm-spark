            "operation": "Reading from text file: `transactions_rdd = spark.sparkContext.textFile(\"path/to/transactions.txt\")`",
            "improvementExplanation": "The code currently reads transaction data from a text file. Text files are inefficient for large datasets because they are not optimized for columnar storage, compression, or predicate pushdown. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance, reduce storage space, and enable query optimization.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Assuming the data is in a CSV file, first read it as a DataFrame\ntransactions_df = spark.read.csv(\"path/to/transactions.csv\", header=False, inferSchema=True)\n\n# Rename columns for clarity\ntransactions_df = transactions_df.toDF(\"transaction_id\", \"customer_id\", \"amount\", \"category\")\n\n# Filter for 'Electronics' category\nelectronics_transactions_df = transactions_df.filter(transactions_df[\"category\"] == \"Electronics\")\n\n# Write the filtered data to Parquet format\nelectronics_transactions_df.write.parquet(\"path/to/electronics_transactions.parquet\")\n\n# Read the Parquet file back\nelectronics_transactions_df = spark.read.parquet(\"path/to/electronics_transactions.parquet\")\n\nprint(\"Sample filtered transactions:\", electronics_transactions_df.take(5))\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet offers several benefits:\n1. **Faster Reads:** Parquet is a columnar format, which means that only the necessary columns are read, leading to faster read times, especially when dealing with large datasets and queries that only access a subset of columns.\n2. **Compression:** Parquet files are highly compressible, reducing storage space and I/O costs.\n3. **Predicate Pushdown:** Parquet supports predicate pushdown, which means that filters are applied during the read process, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed.\n4. **Schema Evolution:** Parquet supports schema evolution, allowing you to add or remove columns without breaking existing data.\n5. **Type Safety:** Parquet stores data with type information, which can help prevent errors and improve performance."
