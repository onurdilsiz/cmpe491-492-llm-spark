      "improvementExplanation": "The code uses `repartition(24)` to increase the number of partitions to 24 before performing a `randomSplit`.  Since `randomSplit` doesn't inherently require a specific number of partitions for its operation, and the goal is to simply split the data, increasing the number of partitions with `repartition` leads to unnecessary data shuffling.  `coalesce` can reduce the number of partitions without shuffling if the target number of partitions is less than or equal to the current number. While this specific example increases partitions, the principle applies if you were to reduce the number of partitions after a heavy operation.  In such cases, `coalesce` would be more efficient.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "If the initial number of partitions is greater than 24:\n\ntrain_coalesced_df, val_coalesced_df, test_coalesced_df = (airbnb_df\n                                             .coalesce(24)\n                                             .randomSplit([.7, .15, .15], seed=42))\n\nIf the initial number of partitions is less than or equal to 24, coalesce is not needed and the repartition can be removed entirely.",
      "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce` in this scenario would eliminate the unnecessary data shuffle caused by `repartition`, leading to improved performance, reduced resource consumption (CPU and network), and faster job completion time.  If the initial partition count is already greater than 24, coalesce would still be more efficient than repartition as it avoids unnecessary shuffling."
