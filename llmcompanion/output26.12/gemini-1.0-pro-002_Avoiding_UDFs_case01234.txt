      "operation": "Using UDF instead of built-in Spark SQL functions (Line 34-38)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The UDF `multiply_by_two` is used to multiply a column by 2. This can be easily achieved using the built-in Spark SQL function `multiply`.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "```python\nresult_without_udf = df.withColumn(\"doubled\", col(\"numbers\") * 2)\nresult_without_udf.show()\n```",
      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with a built-in function offers several benefits:\n- **Catalyst Optimization:** Spark SQL's Catalyst optimizer can effectively optimize expressions involving built-in functions, leading to improved query performance.\n- **Performance Improvement:** Built-in functions are generally optimized for performance and can execute faster than UDFs, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n- **Reduced Serialization Overhead:** UDFs require serialization and deserialization during execution, which can add overhead. Using built-in functions avoids this overhead, resulting in faster execution."
