      "operation": "Reading from variables.json in the get_bucket_links function (lines 16-19)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads configuration data from a JSON file.  JSON is a human-readable format but not optimized for Spark processing.  Switching to a more efficient format is not directly applicable here as it's configuration data, not the main dataset. However, if the configuration data were significantly larger, a more efficient format like YAML could be considered for faster loading.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": null,
      "benefits": "No direct performance improvement by changing the format, but alternative formats like YAML could offer faster loading for very large configuration files."

      "operation": "Reading and writing a NETCDF file in the process_netcdf function (lines 110-112, 146)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code downloads a NETCDF file from S3, processes it using Iris, and then deletes the temporary file.  NETCDF is not a columnar storage format optimized for Spark.  Instead of downloading the entire file and loading it into memory using Iris, it's more efficient to directly read the data from S3 into a Spark DataFrame using a format like Parquet or ORC.  This avoids the intermediate step of creating a temporary file and allows for parallel processing.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nimport boto3\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import *\n\n# ... other code ...\ndef process_netcdf(file_name):\n    # ... other code ...\n    s3 = boto3.client('s3')\n    raw_data_bucket = get_bucket_links()\n    # Read directly from S3 into a Spark DataFrame\n    df = spark.read.format(\"netcdf\").option(\"path\", f\"s3a://{raw_data_bucket}/{file_name}\").load()\n    # ... process the DataFrame ...\n    return dfs\n```",
      "benefits": "Faster data loading, parallel processing, reduced memory usage, and potential for predicate pushdown optimization."
