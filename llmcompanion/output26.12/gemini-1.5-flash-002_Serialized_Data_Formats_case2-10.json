            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a CSV file using sc.textFile(). CSV is a text-based format, leading to slower read times and higher storage costs compared to binary formats like Parquet or ORC.  Parquet and ORC offer better compression, columnar storage, and support for predicate pushdown, resulting in significant performance gains, especially for large datasets. Switching to Parquet or ORC involves replacing sc.textFile() with a function that reads Parquet or ORC files, and potentially adjusting the data processing steps to handle the different file structure.",

            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC offers faster read speeds, reduced storage space due to compression, and improved query performance through features like predicate pushdown and columnar storage.  This is particularly beneficial for large datasets where I/O operations are a major bottleneck."

            "improvementExplanation": "The code writes the results to a text file using a custom format. This approach lacks the efficiency and features of optimized formats like Parquet or ORC.  Switching to Parquet or ORC allows for faster writes, better compression, and easier integration with other data processing tools.  The output data needs to be structured into a DataFrame before writing to Parquet or ORC.",

            "benefits": "Writing to Parquet or ORC results in faster write speeds, smaller file sizes due to compression, and better compatibility with other big data tools.  The columnar storage of Parquet/ORC also enables efficient querying of specific columns if needed in future analysis."
