            "improvementExplanation": "The UDF 'check_prem_typ_desc' is used to determine a specific string based on the length of the input. This logic can be easily achieved using native DataFrame operations without the need for a UDF.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "results = lines.withColumn('prem_typ_desc', F.when(F.length(lines[16]) == 0, 'NULL\tNULL\tNULL').otherwise('TEXT\tPREMISES\tVALID'))",
            "benefits": "By replacing the UDF with a native DataFrame operation, Spark can leverage Catalyst optimizations for better query planning and execution. This can lead to improved performance and reduced serialization overhead."
