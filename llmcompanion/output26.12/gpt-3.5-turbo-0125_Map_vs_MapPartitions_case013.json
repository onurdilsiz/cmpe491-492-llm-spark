            "improvementExplanation": "The map() transformation is used to split each line of the RDD into a list based on the comma delimiter. This operation can be performed more efficiently at the partition level using mapPartitions() to reduce function call overhead.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "parsed_transactions_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda iter: (line.split(\",\") for line in iter))",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() can optimize the splitting operation by processing multiple lines within a partition at once, reducing the overhead of invoking the splitting function for each line individually. This can lead to improved performance, especially for I/O-heavy operations."
