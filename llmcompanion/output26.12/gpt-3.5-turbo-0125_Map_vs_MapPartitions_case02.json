            "improvementExplanation": "The current map() transformation is applied at the element level, which can lead to high function call overhead for each element. By using mapPartitions(), we can process elements in batches at the partition level, reducing overhead and improving efficiency, especially for I/O-heavy operations.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "bonus_rdd = high_salary_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: ((emp[0], emp[1], float(emp[2]) * 1.1) for emp in partition))",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() can reduce function call overhead by processing elements in batches, optimize I/O operations by minimizing per-element processing, and improve performance for partition-level operations."
