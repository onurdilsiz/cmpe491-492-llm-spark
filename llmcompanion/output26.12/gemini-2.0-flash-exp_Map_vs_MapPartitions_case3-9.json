            "improvementExplanation": "The `apply` method on a Pandas DataFrame, which uses a lambda function to parse JSON strings, is similar to a `map` operation in Spark. This operation is applied row-by-row. If the DataFrame were a Spark DataFrame, this operation could be optimized using `mapPartitions` because JSON parsing can be done more efficiently in batches. Instead of parsing each JSON string individually, we can parse a batch of JSON strings within a partition, reducing the overhead of function calls and potentially improving performance.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\ndef parse_json_batch(iterator):\n    for row in iterator:\n        row['details'] = json.loads(row['details'].replace(\"'\", '\"'))\n        yield row\n\n# Assuming df is a Spark DataFrame\ndf = df.mapPartitions(parse_json_batch)\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to `mapPartitions` reduces the overhead of calling the JSON parsing function for each row individually. By processing rows in batches within each partition, we can reduce the number of function calls and potentially improve performance, especially for large datasets. This approach also allows for more efficient resource utilization by processing data in parallel within each partition."

If the DataFrame were a Spark DataFrame, this could be optimized using `mapPartitions` by processing the extraction in batches within each partition. This reduces function call overhead and can improve performance.",
