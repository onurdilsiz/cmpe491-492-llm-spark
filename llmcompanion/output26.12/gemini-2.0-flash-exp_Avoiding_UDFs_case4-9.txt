      "operation": "The UDF `delta_mol` is defined and used on line 35 and 38: `dff = df.withColumn('delta_arry',delta_mol(F.col('array_col')))`",
      "improvementExplanation": "The UDF `delta_mol` calculates the percentage difference between consecutive elements in an array. This can be achieved using Spark's built-in functions and array operations, avoiding the overhead of UDF serialization and execution. We can use `array_zip` to pair consecutive elements, then use `transform` to apply the calculation to each pair. We also need to handle the division by zero case using `when` and `otherwise`.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import functions as F\n\ndef calculate_delta(arr):\n    return F.when(arr[0] != 0.0, (arr[1] / arr[0] - 1) * 100).otherwise(0.0)\n\ndff = df.withColumn(\n    'delta_arry',\n    F.expr('transform(arrays_zip(array_col, slice(array_col, 2, size(array_col))), x -> case when x._1 != 0.0 then (x._2 / x._1 - 1) * 100 else 0.0 end)')\n)\n```",
      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with built-in functions allows Spark's Catalyst optimizer to optimize the execution plan, potentially leading to significant performance improvements. It also avoids the serialization overhead associated with UDFs, as the logic is now expressed in Spark's native operations. This approach is generally more efficient and scalable."
