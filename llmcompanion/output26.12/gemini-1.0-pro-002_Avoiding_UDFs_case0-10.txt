**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of User-Defined Functions (UDFs). All data transformations are performed using Spark's built-in functions and native DataFrame/Dataset operations.

**Benefits of Avoiding UDFs:**

* **Catalyst Optimizations:** Spark's Catalyst optimizer can effectively optimize built-in functions and native operations, resulting in improved query performance.
* **Performance:** Built-in functions and native operations are generally more performant than UDFs, as they are optimized for Spark's execution engine.
* **Serialization Overhead:** UDFs require serialization and deserialization, which can introduce overhead and impact performance. By avoiding UDFs, we can reduce this overhead.

**Conclusion:**

The provided Spark code effectively utilizes Spark's built-in functions and native operations, resulting in optimized and performant data transformations.
