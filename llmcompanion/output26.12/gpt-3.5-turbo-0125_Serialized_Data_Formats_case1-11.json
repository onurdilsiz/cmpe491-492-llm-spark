            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation involves downloading a NETCDF file from an S3 bucket. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can improve performance by leveraging columnar storage, compression, and predicate pushdown optimizations.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "Instead of downloading the NETCDF file, load the data directly into a Spark DataFrame using Parquet or ORC format.",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC format can provide faster reads/writes, efficient storage due to columnar format, compression for reduced storage costs, and query optimization through predicate pushdown."
