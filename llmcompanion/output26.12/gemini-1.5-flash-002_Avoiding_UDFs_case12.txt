      "improvementExplanation": "The lambda function within the `map` transformation on the RDD acts as a UDF.  This can be replaced by using a built-in Spark function with the DataFrame API, which leverages Spark's optimized execution engine (Catalyst).  Applying the discount directly on the DataFrame avoids the overhead of converting to and from RDDs.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "discounted_sales_df = sales_df.withColumn(\"discounted_amount\", sales_df[\"amount\"] * 0.9)",
      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with a DataFrame operation enables Catalyst optimizations, leading to improved performance.  It avoids the serialization and deserialization overhead associated with RDD transformations, resulting in faster execution and reduced resource consumption.  The DataFrame API is generally preferred for its integration with Spark's optimized query planning and execution."
