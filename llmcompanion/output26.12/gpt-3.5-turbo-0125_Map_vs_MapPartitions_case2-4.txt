            "improvementExplanation": "The map() transformation is used to apply the function check_prem_typ_desc() to each element in the RDD individually. However, if the function does not require individual element processing and can be applied at the partition level, using mapPartitions() can improve efficiency by reducing function call overhead.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "results = lines.mapPartitions(lambda iter: map(lambda x: check_prem_typ_desc(x[16]), iter)) \\",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() can reduce the overhead of invoking the function check_prem_typ_desc() for each element, as it will be applied at the partition level. This can lead to improved performance, especially for I/O-heavy operations or functions that can benefit from batch processing."
