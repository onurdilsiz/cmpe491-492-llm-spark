            "improvementExplanation": "The current CSV format is not optimized for Spark processing. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve performance due to faster reads/writes, compression, and query optimization through predicate pushdown.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read the dataset from a Parquet file\ndf_pyspark = spark.read.parquet(\"test2.parquet\")\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC will provide the following benefits:\n* **Faster reads/writes:** Parquet and ORC are columnar formats that allow for efficient data access, resulting in faster read and write operations.\n* **Compression:** Parquet and ORC support compression, which reduces storage space requirements and network transfer times.\n* **Query optimization:** Parquet and ORC enable predicate pushdown, where filters are applied directly on the compressed data, further improving query performance."
