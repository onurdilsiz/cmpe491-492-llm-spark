            "operation": "Reading text files using `sc.textFile(file_path_spam)` and `sc.textFile(file_path_non_spam)`",
            "improvementExplanation": "The code currently reads data from plain text files (`spam.txt` and `Ham.txt`). Text files are not optimized for analytical workloads. They lack schema information, are not compressed, and require parsing on every read. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve performance. Parquet is generally preferred for its good balance of performance and compatibility.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"filter app\").getOrCreate()\n\nfile_path_spam = 'spam.txt'\nfile_path_non_spam = 'Ham.txt'\n\n# Load the datasets into RDDs\nspam_rdd = spark.read.text(file_path_spam).rdd.map(lambda row: row[0])\nnon_spam_rdd = spark.read.text(file_path_non_spam).rdd.map(lambda row: row[0])\n\n# Save as Parquet files (only done once, then load from Parquet)\n# spark.createDataFrame(spam_rdd.map(lambda x: (x,)), ['text']).write.parquet('spam.parquet')\n# spark.createDataFrame(non_spam_rdd.map(lambda x: (x,)), ['text']).write.parquet('ham.parquet')\n\n# Load from Parquet files\n# spam_rdd = spark.read.parquet('spam.parquet').rdd.map(lambda row: row[0])\n# non_spam_rdd = spark.read.parquet('ham.parquet').rdd.map(lambda row: row[0])\n\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet offers several benefits: faster read times due to columnar storage and predicate pushdown, efficient compression, and schema evolution support. This leads to reduced I/O and faster processing, especially for large datasets. The code provided shows how to read the text files, convert them to dataframes, and save them as parquet files. The commented out code shows how to load the parquet files instead of the text files."
