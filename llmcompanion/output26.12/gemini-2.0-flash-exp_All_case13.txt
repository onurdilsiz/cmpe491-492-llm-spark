      "operation": "repartitioned_df.rdd.getNumPartitions()",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code uses `repartitioned_df.rdd.getNumPartitions()` to get the number of partitions. While this is a valid operation on an RDD, it's generally better to work with DataFrames/Datasets directly for better performance and optimization. The number of partitions can be obtained directly from the DataFrame without converting it to an RDD.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "repartitioned_df.rdd.getNumPartitions() can be replaced with repartitioned_df.rdd.getNumPartitions() or by inspecting the DataFrame's internal structure, but it's not necessary for most use cases. The number of partitions is an internal detail and should not be used for logic.",
      "benefits": "Directly working with DataFrames/Datasets allows Spark's Catalyst optimizer to perform optimizations, such as predicate pushdown and query planning. It also avoids unnecessary conversions between DataFrames/Datasets and RDDs, which can be costly."

    {
      "operation": "repartitioned_df = sales_df.repartition(10)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code uses `repartition(10)` which causes a full shuffle of the data across the cluster. Since the goal is to reduce the number of partitions, and not to increase it, `coalesce` is more appropriate. `coalesce` can reduce the number of partitions without a full shuffle, if the target number of partitions is less than the current number of partitions.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "repartitioned_df = sales_df.coalesce(10)",
      "benefits": "Using `coalesce` instead of `repartition` reduces the amount of data shuffling, which can significantly improve performance, especially for large datasets. It also reduces resource usage and job runtime."

      "improvementExplanation": "The code saves the output in CSV format, which is not optimized for Spark. CSV files are text-based and do not support schema evolution or predicate pushdown. Using a serialized format like Parquet, ORC, or Avro is more efficient for Spark.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "electronics_df.write.format(\"parquet\").save(\"path/to/electronics_sales_output.parquet\")",
      "benefits": "Using Parquet, ORC, or Avro provides faster read/write speeds, better compression, and query optimization through predicate pushdown. These formats are also schema-aware, which allows Spark to optimize data access."
