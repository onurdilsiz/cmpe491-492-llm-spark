            "operation": "map() operation on the 'feature_data' array in the 'create_feature_dataframe' function (line 64).",
            "improvementExplanation": "The map() operation iterates over the 'feature_data' array element by element, applying the 'item()' method to each element. This can be inefficient for large arrays, as it incurs significant function call overhead. Replacing map() with mapPartitions() allows us to process the array in partitions, reducing the number of function calls and improving performance.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\nfeature_data = feature_data.mapPartitions(lambda partition: map(lambda x: x.item(), partition))\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() provides the following benefits:\n- Reduced function call overhead: By processing the array in partitions, we reduce the number of function calls required, improving performance.\n- Optimized I/O: mapPartitions() allows for more efficient I/O operations, as data can be processed in larger chunks.\n- Improved resource utilization: By reducing the number of function calls, we can improve resource utilization and reduce the overall execution time."
