            "improvementExplanation": "The `state_convert` function can be replaced with Spark's built-in `map` function and a dictionary lookup. This avoids the overhead of creating and using a UDF, enabling Catalyst optimizations and potentially improving performance.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "```python\nresult = rdd.map(lambda x: (x[0], x[1], x[2], states[x[3]])).collect()\n```",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with a built-in function provides the following benefits:\n- Enables Catalyst optimizations for better query planning and execution.\n- Improves performance by avoiding UDF serialization and execution overhead.\n- Reduces code complexity and improves maintainability."
