    {
      "operation": "spark.read.csv(loc_data, header=True) at line 70",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads location data from a CSV file.  CSV is a text-based format, leading to slower read times and larger file sizes compared to binary formats like Parquet or ORC. Parquet and ORC offer better compression, columnar storage, and support for predicate pushdown, resulting in significantly faster query performance, especially for large datasets.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "df_loc = spark.read.parquet(loc_data)",
      "benefits": "Faster read speeds, reduced storage space, improved query performance due to compression and predicate pushdown."
    },
    {
      "operation": "spark.read.csv(hvl_data, header=True) at line 94",
      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the previous case, reading from a CSV file is inefficient. Switching to Parquet or ORC will improve read performance and reduce storage space.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "df_hvl = spark.read.parquet(hvl_data)",
      "benefits": "Faster read speeds, reduced storage space, improved query performance due to compression and predicate pushdown."
    },
    {
      "operation": "spark.read.csv(weather_data, header=True, inferSchema=True) at line 144",
      "improvementExplanation": "Reading multiple CSV weather files is inefficient.  Parquet or ORC would provide faster reads and better compression, especially given the potential for many small CSV files.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "weather_df = spark.read.parquet(weather_data)",
      "benefits": "Faster read speeds, reduced storage space, improved query performance due to compression and predicate pushdown.  Handles multiple files more efficiently."
    },
    {
      "operation": "df_loc.write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(output_data + \"location/location_table.parquet\") at line 81",
      "improvementExplanation": "While the code writes to Parquet, it's worth noting that the initial read was from CSV.  If the source data were already in Parquet, this write operation would be optimized.  If the source were CSV, the entire process would benefit from using Parquet throughout.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "No change needed; already using Parquet.",
      "benefits": "Maintains efficient Parquet format for faster subsequent reads."
    },
    {
      "operation": "df_trip.write.partitionBy(\"year\", \"month\").mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(output_data + \"trip/trip_table.parquet\") at line 246",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code writes to Parquet, which is efficient. Partitioning by year and month further optimizes query performance by allowing Spark to quickly filter data based on these partitions.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "No change needed; already using Parquet with efficient partitioning.",
      "benefits": "Maintains efficient Parquet format and benefits from partitioning for faster queries."
