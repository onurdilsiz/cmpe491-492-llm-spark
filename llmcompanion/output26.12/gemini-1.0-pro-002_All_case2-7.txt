**Explanation:**

* **DataFrame/Dataset over RDD:** The code does not use RDDs.
* **coalesce() over repartition():** The code does not use repartition().
* **mapPartitions() over map():** The code uses `mapPartitions` instead of `map` for the specific operation, which is a good practice.
* **Serialized Data Formats:** The code does not perform input/output operations.
* **Avoiding UDFs:** The code does not use UDFs.
