      "improvementExplanation": "The apply() method with a lambda function is used to extract values from a nested JSON structure within the 'details' column. This can be replaced by using Spark's built-in functions like `get_json_object` for more efficient processing, especially when dealing with large datasets.  `get_json_object` operates directly on the column, avoiding the need for a UDF and enabling Spark's optimization engine to work more effectively.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "Assuming your Spark DataFrame is named `spark_df`:\n\nspark_df = spark_df.withColumn('oil_value', get_json_object(spark_df.details, '$.oil_value'))\nspark_df = spark_df.withColumn('fuel_liters', get_json_object(spark_df.details, '$.fuel_liters'))",
      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with `get_json_object` allows Spark's Catalyst optimizer to push down the JSON parsing into the execution engine, leading to improved performance and reduced serialization overhead.  It also avoids the overhead of Python UDF execution, which is generally slower than native Spark operations."

      "operation": "lines 32-33: df['day_of_week'] = df['date_insertion'].dt.dayofweek\ndf['hour_of_day'] = df['date_insertion'].dt.hour",
      "improvementExplanation": "These lines use pandas' built-in datetime functions.  While pandas is efficient for smaller datasets, for larger datasets within a Spark environment, it's better to use Spark's built-in date and time functions for better performance and scalability.  These functions can be applied directly to the Spark DataFrame columns without the need for conversion to pandas.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "Assuming your Spark DataFrame is named `spark_df` and 'date_insertion' is a timestamp column:\n\nspark_df = spark_df.withColumn('day_of_week', dayofweek(spark_df.date_insertion))\nspark_df = spark_df.withColumn('hour_of_day', hour(spark_df.date_insertion))",
      "benefits": "Using Spark's built-in date and time functions enables parallel processing across the cluster, significantly improving performance compared to pandas operations on a single machine.  It also avoids the overhead of data transfer between Spark and pandas."
