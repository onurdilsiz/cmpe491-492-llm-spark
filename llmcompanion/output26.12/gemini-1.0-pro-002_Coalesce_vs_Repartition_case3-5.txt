      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition(100)` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the RDD. However, in this case, the subsequent `reduceByKey` operation only requires a single partition to perform the aggregation. Therefore, using `coalesce(1)` instead of `repartition(100)` would achieve the same result with significantly less shuffling and improved resource utilization.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "rdd.coalesce(1)",
      "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce(1)` would reduce the amount of data shuffled across the network, leading to faster job execution and improved resource usage. Additionally, it would avoid the overhead associated with creating and managing a large number of partitions."
