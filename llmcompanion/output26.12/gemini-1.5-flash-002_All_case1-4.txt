      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads a text file into an RDD using spark.read.text.  This can be improved by directly reading the data into a DataFrame using a more efficient format like Parquet or ORC, or if sticking with text, using spark.read.csv with appropriate schema inference or definition. This allows Spark to perform optimizations during query planning and execution.",

      "benefits": "Improved query optimization, reduced shuffling, and easier integration with structured data formats.  Parquet or ORC would offer even greater performance gains."

    {
      "operation": "Line 61: df_5years.repartition(50).write...",
      "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(50) operation performs a full shuffle, which is expensive. Since the goal is to write the data to a file, reducing the number of partitions might be sufficient.  Using coalesce() avoids the full shuffle if the current number of partitions is greater than 50.",

      "benefits": "Reduced shuffling, improved resource usage, and faster job runtime.  Only shuffles if the number of partitions is greater than 50."

      "improvementExplanation": "Writing data in CSV format is inefficient for large datasets.  CSV is not a columnar format and doesn't support compression natively.  Parquet or ORC are columnar formats that support compression and predicate pushdown, leading to significant performance improvements.",

      "benefits": "Faster reads/writes, compression, and query optimization through predicate pushdown. Parquet is generally preferred for its wider ecosystem support."
