            "operation": "file_q3.repartition(4)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(4) operation is used to increase the number of partitions to 4 for better parallelism. However, in this case, the operation does not require a full shuffle as it only needs to reduce the partitions without changing the data distribution.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "file_q3.coalesce(2)",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce(2) instead of repartition(4) will reduce shuffling overhead, optimize resource usage, and potentially speed up the job execution."
