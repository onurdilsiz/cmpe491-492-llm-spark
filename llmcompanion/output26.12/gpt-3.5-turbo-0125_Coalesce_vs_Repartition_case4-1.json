            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used to increase the number of partitions for better parallelism when exploding the 'execute.Results' column. However, in this context, the operation does not require a full shuffle as the data size remains the same. Using coalesce() instead of repartition() can reduce unnecessary shuffling.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "request_df.select(explode(col(\"execute.Results\")).alias(\"results\")).coalesce(request_df.rdd.getNumPartitions())",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() can lead to reduced shuffling overhead, improved resource utilization, and potentially faster job execution."
