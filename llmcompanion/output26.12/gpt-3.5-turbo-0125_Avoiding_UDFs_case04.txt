            "improvementExplanation": "The UDF 'create_greeting' is used to generate a greeting message for each customer based on their name. This UDF can be replaced with a built-in function 'concat' to concatenate the 'name' column with a constant greeting message.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "customer_with_greeting_df = customer_df.withColumn('greeting', concat(lit('Hello, '), customer_df['name']))",
            "benefits": "By replacing the UDF with a built-in function like 'concat', we can leverage Spark's Catalyst optimizer to optimize the query plan. This can lead to better performance by avoiding UDF serialization and deserialization overhead."
