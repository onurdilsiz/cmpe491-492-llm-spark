      "improvementExplanation": "The RDD is created from a list of strings and then transformed using map. This can be more efficiently done using DataFrames. DataFrames provide schema information and allow for query optimization.",

      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "mapped_rdd = rdd.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: [int(line.split(\",\")[0]) * 2 for line in iterator])",
