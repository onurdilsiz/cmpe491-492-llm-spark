      "improvementExplanation": "The UDF `synthetic_page_skeleton_and_paragraphs_udf` can be replaced with a combination of built-in Spark SQL functions and native DataFrame/Dataset operations. This would improve performance by enabling Catalyst optimizations and reducing serialization overhead.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col, explode, array, struct\n\ndef synthetic_page_skeleton_and_paragraphs(p):\n    # Extract skeleton and paragraphs from the pickled Page object\n    skeleton, paragraphs = pickle.loads(p)\n\n    # Apply synthetic entity linking to paragraphs using a custom function\n    def get_bodies_with_synthetic_entity_linking(text):\n        # Implement your synthetic entity linking logic here\n        return bodies\n\n    paragraphs_with_synthetic_entity_linking = paragraphs.rdd.map(lambda p: (p.para_id, get_bodies_with_synthetic_entity_linking(p.get_text())))\n        .toDF(['para_id', 'bodies'])\n\n    # Create a new DataFrame with synthetic skeleton and paragraphs\n    synthetic_df = spark.createDataFrame(\n        [(skeleton, paragraphs_with_synthetic_entity_linking)],\n        ['synthetic_skeleton', 'synthetic_paragraphs']\n    )\n\n    # Return the synthetic skeleton and paragraphs as a bytearray\n    return bytearray(pickle.dumps(synthetic_df.collect()[0]))\n\n# Replace the UDF with the new function\ndf = df.withColumn(\"synthetic_entity_linking\", synthetic_page_skeleton_and_paragraphs(col(\"page_bytearray\")))\n```",
      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with built-in functions and native operations will:\n- Enable Catalyst optimizations for better performance.\n- Reduce serialization overhead by avoiding the need to serialize and deserialize UDFs.\n- Improve code readability and maintainability."
