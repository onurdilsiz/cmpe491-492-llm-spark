      "operation": "repartition(100)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition(100)` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame. However, since the DataFrame is already partitioned by `key`, reducing the number of partitions using `coalesce(100)` would be more efficient. This would avoid a full shuffle and improve resource utilization.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "df.coalesce(100)",
      "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` would:\n- Reduce shuffling, as the data is already partitioned by `key`.\n- Improve resource utilization by reducing the number of partitions.\n- Potentially improve runtime by reducing the overhead of shuffling."
