            "operation": "repartitioned_df = electronics_sales_df.repartition(10)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(10) operation is unnecessarily increasing the number of partitions to 10, which can lead to unnecessary shuffling across nodes. Since the goal is to reduce the number of partitions without a full shuffle, coalesce() can be used instead.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "coalesced_df = electronics_sales_df.coalesce(5)",
            "benefits": "By replacing repartition(10) with coalesce(5), the job can achieve the desired reduction in partitions without triggering a full shuffle. This results in improved resource usage, reduced shuffling overhead, and potentially faster job runtime."
