      "operation": "computeCosineSimilarity function (line 27-44)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `computeCosineSimilarity` function can be replaced with Spark's built-in `corr` function, which calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient between two columns. The Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of linear correlation between two variables, and it is closely related to the cosine similarity. In this case, since we are dealing with movie ratings, which are likely to have a linear relationship, using the Pearson correlation coefficient is a suitable alternative to the cosine similarity.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "```python\n# Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient using corr function\nmoviePairSimilarities = moviePairRatings.mapValues(lambda ratings: ratings.corr())\n```",
      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with `corr` offers several benefits:\n\n* **Catalyst Optimization:** `corr` is a built-in function, which means it can be optimized by Catalyst, Spark's query optimizer. This can lead to significant performance improvements, especially for large datasets.\n* **Improved Performance:** `corr` is likely to be more efficient than the custom UDF, as it is implemented in optimized native code.\n* **Reduced Serialization Overhead:** UDFs require serialization and deserialization, which can add overhead. Using `corr` avoids this overhead, as it is a built-in function."
