            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads transaction data from a text file (\"path/to/transactions.txt\") using the RDD API.  Text files are not optimized for Spark processing.  They lack schema information, leading to inefficient parsing and data processing.  Switching to a columnar storage format like Parquet or ORC provides significant performance improvements.  Parquet and ORC offer schema enforcement, compression, and support for predicate pushdown, resulting in faster query execution and reduced storage costs.",

            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC offers several benefits:\n\n* **Faster Reads/Writes:** Columnar storage allows Spark to read only the necessary columns, significantly reducing I/O operations.\n* **Compression:** Parquet and ORC employ efficient compression algorithms, reducing storage space and improving read performance.\n* **Schema Enforcement:**  Provides schema information, enabling faster data processing and preventing data type errors.\n* **Predicate Pushdown:**  Allows Spark to filter data at the storage level, further reducing the amount of data processed."
