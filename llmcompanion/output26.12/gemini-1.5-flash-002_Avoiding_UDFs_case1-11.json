            "operation": "The `utc_timestamp` function is used within the `create_feature_dataframe` function (lines 70-78 and 92-93) to convert epoch time (in hours) to a timestamp string.",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `utc_timestamp` UDF can be replaced by using Spark's built-in functions for timestamp manipulation.  Instead of converting the epoch time to a string in Python and then casting it to a timestamp in Spark, we can directly perform the conversion within Spark using `from_unixtime`. This avoids the overhead of transferring data to the driver for processing and back to the executors.",

            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with built-in Spark functions offers several advantages:\n\n* **Catalyst Optimization:** Spark's Catalyst optimizer can push down the timestamp conversion into the execution plan, leading to more efficient processing.\n* **Performance Improvement:** Eliminates the overhead of data serialization and deserialization between Python and Spark.\n* **Reduced Serialization Overhead:**  Avoids the cost of transferring data to the driver for UDF execution and back to the executors. This is particularly beneficial for large datasets.\n* **Improved Code Readability:** The code becomes cleaner and easier to understand by using built-in functions."
