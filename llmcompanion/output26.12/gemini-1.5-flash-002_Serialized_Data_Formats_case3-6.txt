      "operation": "Reading CSV file into a DataFrame at line 81: `customerDF = spark.read.csv(\"retailstore.csv\",header=True)`",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a CSV file, which is a text-based format.  CSV files are not optimized for Spark's distributed processing.  They lack features like columnar storage, compression, and metadata that can significantly improve query performance. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC allows Spark to read only the necessary columns for a given query, resulting in faster query execution and reduced I/O operations.  Furthermore, Parquet and ORC offer built-in compression, reducing storage space and network transfer times.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "customerDF = spark.read.parquet(\"retailstore.parquet\")\n# Or\ncustomerDF = spark.read.orc(\"retailstore.orc\")\n# Note: This requires saving the data in Parquet or ORC format beforehand using `.write.parquet()` or `.write.orc()`",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC offers several benefits:\n* **Faster read/write speeds:** Columnar storage allows Spark to read only the required columns, significantly reducing I/O.\n* **Improved compression:** Parquet and ORC provide efficient compression, reducing storage space and network transfer times.\n* **Predicate pushdown:**  These formats support predicate pushdown, allowing Spark to filter data at the storage level, further improving query performance.\n* **Schema enforcement:**  Parquet and ORC store schema information, improving data integrity and reducing processing overhead."
