**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of User-Defined Functions (UDFs). Therefore, there are no occurrences of UDFs to analyze and replace.

**Benefits of Avoiding UDFs:**

While UDFs can be useful for extending Spark's functionality, they can also introduce performance overhead and limit optimization opportunities. By avoiding UDFs whenever possible and leveraging Spark's built-in functions and native DataFrame/Dataset operations, we can achieve the following benefits:

- **Enable Catalyst Optimizations:** Spark's Catalyst optimizer can effectively optimize native DataFrame/Dataset operations, resulting in improved query performance. UDFs, on the other hand, can hinder these optimizations.
- **Improve Performance:** Native DataFrame/Dataset operations are generally more performant than UDFs, as they are implemented in Scala and compiled to bytecode. UDFs, written in Python, incur additional serialization and deserialization overhead.
- **Reduce Serialization Overhead:** UDFs require serialization and deserialization between Python and the JVM, which can add significant overhead. Native DataFrame/Dataset operations avoid this overhead.

**Conclusion:**

In the provided Spark code, there are no UDFs to replace. By consistently leveraging Spark's built-in functions and native DataFrame/Dataset operations, we can achieve optimal performance and efficiency in our Spark applications.
