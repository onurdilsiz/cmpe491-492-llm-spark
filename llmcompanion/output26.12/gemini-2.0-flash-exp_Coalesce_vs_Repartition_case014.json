            "operation": "repartitioned_df = transactions_df.repartition(10)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The code uses `repartition(10)` to increase the number of partitions to 10. Since the goal is to reduce the number of partitions, `coalesce()` can be used instead. `repartition()` always triggers a full shuffle, which is unnecessary when reducing partitions. `coalesce()` can reduce the number of partitions without a full shuffle, making it more efficient.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "repartitioned_df = transactions_df.coalesce(10)",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` avoids a full shuffle, which reduces data movement across the network. This leads to improved resource usage, faster job runtime, and reduced overhead."
