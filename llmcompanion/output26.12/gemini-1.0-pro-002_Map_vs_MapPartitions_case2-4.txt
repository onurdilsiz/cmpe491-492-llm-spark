      "improvementExplanation": "The `map()` operation is used to apply the `check_prem_typ_desc()` function to each element of the `lines` RDD. This function performs a transformation on each individual element, which can be inefficient when dealing with large datasets. By using `mapPartitions()`, we can process elements in batches, reducing the number of function calls and improving performance.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "lines.mapPartitions(lambda partition: map(lambda x: check_prem_typ_desc(x[16]), partition))",
      "benefits": "Switching to `mapPartitions()` offers several benefits:\n\n* **Reduced function call overhead:** By processing elements in batches, we reduce the number of times the `check_prem_typ_desc()` function is called, leading to improved performance.\n* **Optimized I/O:** `mapPartitions()` allows for more efficient I/O operations, as data can be read and processed in larger chunks.\n* **Improved resource utilization:** By processing data in parallel within partitions, `mapPartitions()` can make better use of available resources."
