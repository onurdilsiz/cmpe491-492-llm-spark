            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame to 1. However, since the subsequent operation is writing the DataFrame to a CSV file, which is a single-partition operation, the full shuffle caused by `repartition()` is unnecessary. Using `coalesce()` instead would achieve the same result of writing to a single partition without incurring the overhead of a full shuffle.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df_5years.coalesce(1).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").mode(\"overwrite\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000-2005/repartition/1\")",
            "benefits": "Replacing `repartition()` with `coalesce()` in this case would provide the following benefits:\n\n* **Reduced shuffling:** `coalesce()` avoids the full shuffle required by `repartition()`, leading to improved performance and reduced resource usage.\n* **Improved resource usage:** By avoiding unnecessary shuffling, `coalesce()` can free up resources that can be used for other tasks, potentially improving overall job runtime.\n* **Faster runtime:** The reduced shuffling and improved resource utilization can lead to a faster overall job execution time."
