```json
{
  "detected": false,
  "occurrences": 0,
  "response": []
}
```

**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of User-Defined Functions (UDFs). Therefore, the `detected` field is set to `false`, and the `occurrences` field is set to `0`. The `response` array is empty as there are no UDFs to analyze.

**Benefits of Avoiding UDFs:**

While UDFs can be useful in certain scenarios, they can also have drawbacks, such as:

- **Catalyst Optimization Limitations:** UDFs cannot be optimized by Catalyst, Spark's query optimizer. This can lead to performance degradation.
- **Serialization Overhead:** UDFs need to be serialized and deserialized when passed between executors, which can add overhead.
- **Limited Functionality:** UDFs are limited to the functions available in the programming language they are written in.

By avoiding UDFs and using Spark's built-in functions or native DataFrame/Dataset operations whenever possible, you can improve the performance, efficiency, and maintainability of your Spark code.
