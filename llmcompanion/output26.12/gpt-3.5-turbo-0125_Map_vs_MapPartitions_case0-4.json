            "operation": "rdd.map(lambda x: (x[0],x[1],x[2],state_convert(x[3]))).collect()",
            "improvementExplanation": "In this case, the map() transformation is used to apply a function that involves a broadcast variable lookup for each element in the RDD. By using mapPartitions(), we can reduce the overhead of repeated function calls and improve efficiency by performing the transformation at the partition level.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "result = rdd.mapPartitions(lambda iter: [(x[0], x[1], x[2], state_convert(x[3])) for x in iter]).collect()",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() can lead to reduced function call overhead as the transformation is applied at the partition level, optimizing I/O operations and improving performance for partition-level operations."
