      "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame. However, since the output format is CSV, which is not a serialized format, the shuffling caused by repartition() will not provide significant performance benefits. Additionally, the number of partitions is set to 1, which means there will be no shuffling anyway.",

      "benefits": "Replacing repartition() with coalesce() will avoid unnecessary shuffling, reduce resource usage, and potentially improve job runtime."

      "improvementExplanation": "The input data is read from a CSV file, which is not an optimized format for Spark. Using serialized formats like Parquet, ORC, or Avro can significantly improve read performance, reduce storage space, and enable query optimization through predicate pushdown.",
