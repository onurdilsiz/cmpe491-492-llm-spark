            "operation": "Read from CSV file: `raw_ratings = sc.textFile(\"ratings.csv\")`",
            "improvementExplanation": "The code currently reads data from a CSV file. CSV is a text-based format, which is inefficient for large datasets due to its lack of schema, lack of compression, and the need to parse each line. Switching to a columnar, binary format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance, reduce storage space, and enable predicate pushdown for query optimization.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Assuming you have a Parquet file named 'ratings.parquet'\nraw_ratings = spark.read.parquet(\"ratings.parquet\")\n# The rest of the code would need to be adjusted to work with DataFrames instead of RDDs\n# Example of how to convert to RDD if needed:\nparsed_ratings = raw_ratings.rdd.map(lambda row: [str(x) for x in row])\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC offers several benefits: faster read times due to columnar storage and binary format, significant storage savings due to compression, and query optimization through predicate pushdown, which allows Spark to read only the necessary columns and rows."

            "operation": "Write to text file: `final_movies.saveAsTextFile(\"popular_movies_output\")`",
            "improvementExplanation": "The code currently saves the final results to a text file. Similar to reading from CSV, writing to a text file is inefficient for large datasets. It lacks schema, compression, and is not optimized for analytical queries. Saving the results in a columnar, binary format like Parquet or ORC would improve write performance and make the data more suitable for further analysis.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Assuming you have a SparkSession named 'spark'\n# Convert RDD to DataFrame\nfinal_movies_df = spark.createDataFrame(final_movies, [\"movie_id\", \"ratings_data\"])\nfinal_movies_df.write.parquet(\"popular_movies_output_parquet\")\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC for output provides faster write times, significant storage savings due to compression, and makes the data readily available for efficient querying in subsequent Spark jobs or other analytical tools."
