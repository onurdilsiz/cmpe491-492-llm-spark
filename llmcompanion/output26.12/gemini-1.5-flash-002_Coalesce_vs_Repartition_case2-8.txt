      "improvementExplanation": "This `repartition()` is used to redistribute the data across `self.num_workers` partitions before training.  If the current number of partitions is already greater than or equal to `self.num_workers`, a full shuffle is unnecessary. `coalesce()` can reduce the number of partitions without shuffling if the target number of partitions is less than or equal to the current number.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "rdd = rdd.coalesce(self.num_workers, shuffle=True)",
      "benefits": "Using `coalesce()` with `shuffle=True` ensures that the number of partitions is reduced to `self.num_workers`. If the initial number of partitions is already less than or equal to `self.num_workers`, it avoids a costly shuffle operation, leading to improved performance and resource utilization."

    {
      "operation": "Line 241: `rdd = rdd.repartition(self.num_workers)`",
      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the previous case, this `repartition()` aims to redistribute data for training.  Unnecessary shuffling can occur if the initial partition count is already sufficient. `coalesce()` provides a more efficient alternative in such scenarios.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "rdd = rdd.coalesce(self.num_workers, shuffle=True)",
      "benefits": "Replacing `repartition()` with `coalesce(self.num_workers, shuffle=True)` avoids unnecessary data shuffling when the existing number of partitions is greater than or equal to `self.num_workers`. This results in faster execution and reduced resource consumption."
