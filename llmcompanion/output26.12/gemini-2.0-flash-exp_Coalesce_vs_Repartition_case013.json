            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions to 10. However, since we are not increasing the number of partitions to a higher number than the existing partitions, and we are not performing any operation that requires a specific number of partitions, we can use `coalesce()` to reduce the number of partitions to 10. `coalesce()` avoids a full shuffle by combining existing partitions, which is more efficient than `repartition()` which always performs a full shuffle.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "repartitioned_df = filtered_transactions_df.coalesce(10)",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` reduces the amount of data shuffling, which leads to improved resource usage and faster job runtime. `coalesce()` avoids a full shuffle by combining existing partitions, making it more efficient than `repartition()` when reducing the number of partitions."
