            "improvementExplanation": "The RDD map operation is inefficient for this task because it processes data in a row-by-row manner without leveraging Spark's optimized execution engine.  DataFrames provide built-in schema enforcement and optimization opportunities.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "customer_df = spark.read.csv(\"path/to/customers.txt\", header=False, inferSchema=True)\ncustomer_df = customer_df.withColumnRenamed('_c0', 'customer_id').withColumnRenamed('_c1', 'name').withColumnRenamed('_c2', 'age').withColumnRenamed('_c3', 'city')",
            "benefits": "Using DataFrame's CSV reading capabilities avoids manual parsing and enables Spark's optimized query execution plan, leading to significant performance gains, especially on large datasets.  It also provides schema enforcement and data type inference, improving data quality and reducing errors."

            "rddOperation": "adult_customers_rdd.filter(lambda cust: int(cust[2]) >= 18) (line 16)",
            "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the map operation, the RDD filter is less efficient than DataFrame's built-in filtering capabilities. DataFrames can push down the filter condition to the underlying data source, reducing data movement and improving performance.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "adult_customer_df = customer_df.filter(customer_df[\"age\"] >= 18)",
            "benefits": "DataFrame's filter operation leverages Catalyst optimizer for efficient query planning and execution. This results in reduced data shuffling and improved performance, especially for large datasets.  It also simplifies the code and makes it more readable."
