            "operation": "The UDF `executeRestApi` is used on line 28 to make a REST API request and return the response as a JSON object.",
            "improvementExplanation": "This UDF can be replaced with Spark's built-in `read.json` function to directly read the JSON response from the API endpoint. This avoids the need for a custom UDF and leverages Spark's optimized JSON parsing capabilities.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "```python\n# Read JSON data directly from the API endpoint\nresponse_df = spark.read.json(\"https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/vehicles/getallmakes?format=json\")\n```",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with `read.json` offers several benefits:\n- **Catalyst Optimizations:** Spark can optimize the JSON parsing using Catalyst, potentially improving performance.\n- **Improved Performance:** Reading JSON directly can be more efficient than using a custom UDF.\n- **Reduced Serialization Overhead:** Avoiding UDFs reduces serialization overhead, as custom functions need to be serialized and sent to executors."
