            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(1000) operation is used to increase the number of partitions to 1000, which might lead to unnecessary shuffling and resource overhead. Since the subsequent operation is coalescing to 1 partition, using coalesce() directly after sorting can avoid the unnecessary shuffle caused by repartition().",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df = df.sort(asc('time')).coalesce(1)",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce(1) after sorting can reduce shuffling overhead, improve resource usage, and potentially speed up the job runtime."
