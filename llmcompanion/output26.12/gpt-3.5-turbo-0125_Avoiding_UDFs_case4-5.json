            "improvementExplanation": "The UDF 'synthetic_page_skeleton_and_paragraphs_udf' is used to create a new Page.skeleton with synthetic entity linking and paragraph list. This UDF can be replaced with native DataFrame operations and transformations to improve performance and leverage Spark's built-in functions.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "Instead of using the UDF, the logic within 'synthetic_page_skeleton_and_paragraphs_udf' can be implemented using DataFrame operations like 'withColumn', 'select', and 'explode' along with Spark's built-in functions for text processing and transformations.",
            "benefits": "By replacing the UDF with native DataFrame operations, you can benefit from Catalyst optimizations, reduce serialization overhead, and improve overall performance of the Spark job."
