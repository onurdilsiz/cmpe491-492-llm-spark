            "operation": "repartitioned_df = usd_transactions_df.repartition(10)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(10) operation is used to increase the number of partitions to 10, which can be inefficient as it involves a full shuffle of data across the cluster. Since the goal is to reduce partitions for writing, coalesce() can be used instead to minimize shuffling.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "coalesced_df = usd_transactions_df.coalesce(5)",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce(5) instead of repartition(10) will reduce unnecessary shuffling, optimize resource usage by minimizing data movement, and potentially lead to faster job execution."
