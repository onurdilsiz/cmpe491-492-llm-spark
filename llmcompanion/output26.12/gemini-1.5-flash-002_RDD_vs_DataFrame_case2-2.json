            "rddOperation": "rows.mapPartitions(initializeData) (line 702)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The RDD operation `mapPartitions` is used to convert binary tensor files into NumPy arrays.  DataFrames provide optimized data loading and processing capabilities, including built-in support for various data formats.  Using a DataFrame would eliminate the need for manual file reading and NumPy array creation within the `mapPartitions` function, leading to improved performance and reduced overhead.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "Assuming the binary files are in a format that can be directly read by Spark (e.g., Parquet), a DataFrame can be created using `spark.read.format('binaryfile').load(inputDir)`.  If not, a custom schema would need to be defined.  Subsequent operations would then be performed using DataFrame transformations.",
            "benefits": "Improved data loading performance, reduced memory usage, and better scalability due to Spark's optimized DataFrame engine."

            "rddOperation": "tensorRDD.mapPartitions(getTensorDimensions) (line 712)",
            "improvementExplanation": "This RDD operation calculates tensor dimensions. DataFrames offer built-in functions for schema inference and metadata extraction, making this operation more efficient and eliminating the need for custom RDD processing.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "The tensor dimensions can be inferred directly from the DataFrame schema after loading the data.  For example, `df.printSchema()` would display the schema, including the dimensions of the tensor columns.",
            "benefits": "Eliminates the need for a separate RDD operation, reducing overhead and improving performance.  Schema inference is more robust and accurate than manual dimension calculation."

            "improvementExplanation": "This RDD operation saves factor matrices. DataFrames provide efficient write operations to various storage systems, including HDFS.  Using a DataFrame would leverage Spark's optimized writing capabilities, resulting in faster data persistence.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "After processing the data in a DataFrame, the results can be saved directly using `df.write.format('parquet').save(outputDir)`.  This would replace the manual file saving and HDFS interaction within the RDD operation.",
            "benefits": "Improved write performance, reduced overhead, and better integration with Spark's storage management."

            "improvementExplanation": "This RDD operation uses `reduceByKeyLocally` for aggregation. DataFrames provide optimized aggregation functions like `groupBy` and `agg`, which are significantly more efficient for large datasets.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "The aggregation can be performed using DataFrame operations.  For example, `df.groupBy('key').agg(sum('value'))` would perform the equivalent aggregation.",
