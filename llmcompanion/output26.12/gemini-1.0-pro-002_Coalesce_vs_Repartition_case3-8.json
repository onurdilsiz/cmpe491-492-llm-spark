            "operation": "repartition(128)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition(128)` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the RDD. However, in this case, the RDD is already created with 128 partitions, so using `repartition(128)` is redundant and can potentially lead to unnecessary shuffling and increased execution time. Replacing it with `coalesce(128)` would achieve the same effect of maintaining the same number of partitions without incurring the overhead of shuffling data.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "coalesce(128)",
            "benefits": "Using `coalesce(128)` instead of `repartition(128)` would: \n- Avoid unnecessary shuffling of data, leading to faster execution times. \n- Reduce resource usage by avoiding the creation of additional partitions. \n- Improve overall performance by optimizing data distribution."
