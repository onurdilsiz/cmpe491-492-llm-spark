      "operation": "parsed_customer_rdd = customer_rdd.map(lambda line: line.split(\",\"))",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `map` operation here splits each line of the input text file by commas. This is a row-wise operation. Since the splitting logic is simple and doesn't require any state or shared resources, it can be performed at the partition level using `mapPartitions`. This will reduce the function call overhead as the lambda function will be called once per partition instead of once per record.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "parsed_customer_rdd = customer_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda lines: (line.split(\",\") for line in lines))",
      "benefits": "Switching to `mapPartitions` reduces function call overhead by applying the splitting logic once per partition instead of once per record. This can lead to significant performance improvements, especially for large datasets, as it reduces the number of function calls and allows for more efficient processing of data within each partition."
