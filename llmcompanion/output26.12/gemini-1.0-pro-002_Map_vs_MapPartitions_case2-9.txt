      "improvementExplanation": "The `region_counts7` function can be applied at the partition level because it only requires information about the cells within a 7x7 region around each cell in the partition. This means that the function can be applied to each partition independently, without the need to shuffle data across partitions. By using `mapPartitions`, we can avoid the overhead of shuffling data and improve the performance of the operation.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\ncells_counts = inputPoints.mapPartitions(lambda partition: [(cell, region_counts7((cell, count))) for cell, count in pointToCell(partition)])\n```",
      "benefits": "Reduced function call overhead, optimized I/O, and improved resource utilization."
    },

      "operation": "map(region_counts3) on line 49",
      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to `region_counts7`, the `region_counts3` function can also be applied at the partition level because it only requires information about the cells within a 3x3 region around each cell in the partition. By using `mapPartitions`, we can avoid the overhead of shuffling data and improve the performance of the operation.",
