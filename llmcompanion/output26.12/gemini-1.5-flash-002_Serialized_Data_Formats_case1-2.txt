      "operation": "Reading CSV data from `hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/csv-file` (line 10)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a CSV file, which is a text-based format.  CSV files are not optimized for storage or query performance in Spark.  Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC significantly improves performance by enabling efficient data access and compression.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "df1 = spark.read.parquet(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/parquet-file\")",
      "benefits": "Parquet or ORC offer faster read/write speeds, better compression, and enable predicate pushdown for improved query performance.  Columnar storage allows Spark to only read the necessary columns, reducing I/O operations."

      "operation": "Writing CSV data to `hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/repartition/1` (lines 36-38)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code writes data to a CSV file.  Similar to reading, writing CSV is inefficient.  Parquet or ORC provide significant performance gains during write operations due to their optimized storage format and compression.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "df2.repartition(1).write.format(\"parquet\").mode(\"overwrite\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/repartition/1\")",
      "benefits": "Parquet or ORC offer faster write speeds due to efficient encoding and compression.  The resulting files are smaller, reducing storage costs and improving read performance in subsequent operations."
