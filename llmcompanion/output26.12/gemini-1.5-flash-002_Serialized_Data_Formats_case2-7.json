            "operation": "Reading data from a text file (dataset) using sc.textFile(dataset, 40) on line 32.",
            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a text file, which is inefficient for large datasets.  Text files lack built-in compression and schema enforcement, leading to slower read times and increased storage costs. Switching to a columnar storage format like Parquet or ORC offers significant performance improvements. Parquet and ORC support compression, efficient columnar storage, and predicate pushdown, enabling faster query execution and reduced I/O operations.  They also provide schema enforcement, improving data integrity and reducing the risk of data corruption.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark import SparkContext, SparkConf\nfrom operator import add\nimport numpy as np\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport time\n\n#dataset = \"data-2-sample.txt\"\ndataset = \"data-2.parquet\" # Assuming data is converted to Parquet\n\nconf = (SparkConf()\n        .setAppName(\"amatakos\")\n        .setMaster(\"spark://alex:7077\")\n        .set(\"spark.rdd.compress\", \"true\")\n        .set(\"spark.driver.memory\", \"1g\")\n        .set(\"spark.executor.memory\", \"1g\")\n        .set(\"spark.cores.max\", \"10\")\n        .set(\"spark.broadcast.compress\", \"true\"))\nsc = SparkContext(conf=conf)\nsc.setLogLevel(\"WARN\")\n\n# ... rest of the code remains the same ...\nA = sc.read.parquet(dataset).rdd.map(lambda row: [float(x) for x in row]).cache()\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC offers the following benefits:\n- **Faster read/write speeds:** Columnar storage and compression significantly reduce I/O operations.\n- **Improved compression:** Reduces storage space and network transfer costs.\n- **Predicate pushdown:** Enables Spark to filter data at the storage level, further improving query performance.\n- **Schema enforcement:** Improves data integrity and reduces the risk of data corruption."
