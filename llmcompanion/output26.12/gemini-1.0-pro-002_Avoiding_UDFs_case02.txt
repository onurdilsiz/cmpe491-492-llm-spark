```json
{
  "detected": false,
  "occurrences": 0,
  "response": []
}
```

**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of User-Defined Functions (UDFs). Therefore, the `detected` field is set to `false`, and the `occurrences` field is set to `0`. Consequently, the `response` array is empty.

**Analysis:**

The code demonstrates several examples of inefficient data processing practices, such as using RDDs instead of DataFrames/Datasets and applying transformations using `map()` instead of `mapPartitions()`. However, it does not involve any UDFs.

**Recommendations:**

To improve the code's efficiency and performance, consider the following:

- Use DataFrames/Datasets instead of RDDs for structured data processing.
- Utilize `mapPartitions()` for more efficient per-partition processing.
- Explore Spark SQL functions and native DataFrame/Dataset operations to avoid UDFs whenever possible.

By following these recommendations, you can leverage Spark's built-in capabilities for optimized data analysis.
