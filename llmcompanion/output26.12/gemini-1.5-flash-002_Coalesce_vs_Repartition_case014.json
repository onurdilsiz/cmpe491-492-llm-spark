            "improvementExplanation": "The code uses `repartition(10)` after creating the `transactions_df` DataFrame.  This forces a full shuffle of the data across 10 partitions, regardless of the initial number of partitions in `transactions_df`. If the goal is simply to reduce the number of partitions and the initial number of partitions is greater than 10, `coalesce(10)` would be more efficient, avoiding a full shuffle and only performing a redistribution if the number of partitions needs to be reduced. If the initial number of partitions is less than 10, `coalesce` will simply return the original DataFrame without any changes.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "repartitioned_df = transactions_df.coalesce(10)",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce(10)` offers significant performance gains when the initial number of partitions is greater than 10. It avoids the costly full data shuffle associated with `repartition()`, leading to reduced resource consumption (CPU, memory, network), and faster job completion times. If the initial number of partitions is less than 10, `coalesce` will not perform any operation, resulting in no performance overhead."
