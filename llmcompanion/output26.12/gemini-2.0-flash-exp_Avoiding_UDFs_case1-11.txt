    {
      "operation": "The `utc_timestamp` function is used within the `create_feature_dataframe` function, specifically in the loops where time values are processed. For example, `time = utc_timestamp(time)`.",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `utc_timestamp` function converts a time value (hours since an epoch) to a formatted timestamp string. This can be achieved using Spark's built-in functions for timestamp manipulation. Specifically, we can convert the hours to seconds, create a timestamp from the epoch, and then format it as a string. This avoids the overhead of a Python UDF and allows Spark to optimize the operation.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import expr, to_timestamp, date_format\n\n# Assuming 'time' is in hours since epoch\ndf = df.withColumn(\"time\",\n    date_format(\n        to_timestamp(expr(\"time * 3600\")), \"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\"\n    )\n)\n```",
      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with Spark's built-in functions enables Catalyst optimizations, improves performance by avoiding serialization and deserialization overhead between Python and JVM, and allows Spark to perform the operation in a distributed manner."
