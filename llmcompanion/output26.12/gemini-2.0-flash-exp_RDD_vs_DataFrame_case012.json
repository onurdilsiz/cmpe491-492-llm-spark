            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads a text file as an RDD, then uses `map` to split each line and `filter` to select USD transactions. This is inefficient because Spark cannot optimize these operations as well as it can with DataFrames. The schema is not defined, and Spark has to infer it, which is less efficient than using a DataFrame with a defined schema.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "transactions_df = spark.read.csv(\"path/to/transactions.txt\", header=False, schema=\"transaction_id STRING, amount DOUBLE, currency STRING\")\nusd_transactions_df = transactions_df.filter(transactions_df.currency == \"USD\")",
            "benefits": "Using DataFrames allows Spark to leverage its Catalyst optimizer, which can perform query optimizations like predicate pushdown and column pruning. This can significantly reduce the amount of data processed and shuffled. DataFrames also provide a schema, which allows Spark to perform type checking and other optimizations. Reading directly into a DataFrame is more efficient than reading into an RDD and then parsing it."

            "rddOperation": "repartitioned_df = usd_transactions_df.repartition(10)",
            "improvementExplanation": "Using `repartition(10)` increases the number of partitions to 10. If the goal is to reduce the number of partitions for writing, `coalesce` should be used instead of `repartition`. `repartition` always triggers a full shuffle, which is expensive. If the goal is to reduce the number of partitions, `coalesce` is more efficient as it avoids a full shuffle if possible.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "coalesced_df = usd_transactions_df.coalesce(1)",
            "benefits": "Using `coalesce(1)` will reduce the number of partitions to 1, which is more efficient for writing to a single file. `coalesce` avoids a full shuffle if the target number of partitions is less than the current number of partitions, making it more efficient than `repartition` for reducing partitions. This reduces the amount of data shuffled across the network, leading to faster execution."

            "rddOperation": "amounts_rdd = usd_transactions_rdd.map(lambda txn: float(txn[1]))",
            "improvementExplanation": "The code uses `map` to convert the amount from string to float. This is inefficient because it processes each element individually. DataFrames can perform this operation more efficiently using vectorized operations.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "amounts_df = usd_transactions_df.select(usd_transactions_df[\"amount\"].cast(\"double\"))",
            "benefits": "Using `select` with `cast` on a DataFrame allows Spark to perform the type conversion in a vectorized manner, which is much more efficient than processing each element individually with `map`. This reduces the overhead of processing each element and allows Spark to leverage its optimized execution engine. It also allows for better query optimization."
