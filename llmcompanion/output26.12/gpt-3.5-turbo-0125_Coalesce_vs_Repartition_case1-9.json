            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(1) operation is used to reduce the number of partitions to 1 for writing the data. However, since the goal is to reduce the partitions without a full shuffle, coalesce() can be more efficient in this scenario.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "filteredPaths.coalesce(1).write.mode('append').format('parquet').saveAsTable(dbName+'.'+tblName, partitionBy='extract_dt', compression= 'snappy')",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce(1) instead of repartition(1) will lead to reduced shuffling, better resource utilization, and potentially faster job runtime."
