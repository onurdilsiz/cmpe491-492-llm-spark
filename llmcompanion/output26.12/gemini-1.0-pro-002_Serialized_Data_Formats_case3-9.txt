      "operation": "Read CSV file",
      "location": "Line 1: df = pd.read_csv('/Users/mac/Downloads/predictive.csv')",
      "improvementExplanation": "Reading a CSV file can be slow and inefficient, especially for large datasets. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve read performance due to their optimized columnar storage and compression capabilities.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nimport pyspark.sql.functions as F\n\ndf = spark.read.parquet('/Users/mac/Downloads/predictive.parquet')\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC will provide the following benefits:\n* **Faster reads:** Parquet and ORC use columnar storage, which allows for faster data access by only reading the required columns instead of the entire row. Additionally, their compression capabilities further reduce the amount of data that needs to be read.\n* **Reduced storage space:** Parquet and ORC compress data efficiently, resulting in smaller file sizes compared to CSV. This can significantly reduce storage costs.\n* **Improved query optimization:** Parquet and ORC support predicate pushdown, which allows Spark to filter data at the file level before reading it into memory. This can significantly improve query performance, especially for complex queries with multiple filters."
