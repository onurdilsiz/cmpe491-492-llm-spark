      "operation": "Reading data from a CSV file",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current code reads data from a CSV file, which is a text-based format that is not optimized for Spark processing. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance due to their columnar storage and compression capabilities.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read data from a Parquet file\nuser_basket = sc.read.parquet(input_file)\n```",
      "benefits": "Reading data from Parquet or ORC files would provide the following benefits:\n* **Faster reads:** Columnar storage allows for efficient data access by only reading the required columns, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed.\n* **Compression:** Parquet and ORC files are compressed, which reduces storage space and network transfer times.\n* **Query optimization:** Spark can leverage the metadata in Parquet and ORC files for query optimization, such as predicate pushdown, further improving performance."

      "improvementExplanation": "The current code writes data to a CSV file, which is not an efficient format for storing large datasets. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC would improve write performance and reduce storage space requirements.",
