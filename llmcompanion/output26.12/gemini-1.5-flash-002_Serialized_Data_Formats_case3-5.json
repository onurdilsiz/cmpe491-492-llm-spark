            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads station data from a CSV file. CSV is a text-based format, leading to slower read times and higher storage costs compared to binary formats like Parquet or ORC.  Parquet and ORC offer better compression, columnar storage for faster query processing, and support for predicate pushdown, significantly improving performance, especially for large datasets. Switching to Parquet or ORC would eliminate the need for parsing each line and improve overall efficiency.",

            "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the stations data, the temperature readings are loaded from a CSV file.  The same performance bottlenecks apply.  Switching to Parquet or ORC will provide substantial performance gains, especially given the likely size of the temperature readings dataset.",
