            "improvementExplanation": "The UDF 'find_candidate' is used to count the occurrences of items in baskets and yield items that meet a certain support threshold. This UDF can be replaced with native DataFrame operations like groupBy, count, and filter to achieve the same functionality more efficiently.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "user_basket.flatMap(lambda x: x)\n    .groupBy('value')\n    .count()\n    .filter(col('count') >= sub_support)\n    .select('value')",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with native DataFrame operations allows Spark to optimize the execution plan using Catalyst, leading to potential performance improvements by leveraging built-in optimizations and reducing serialization overhead."
