      "operation": "Writing to CSV file: `pd.DataFrame(result).to_csv(\"rbmWeights.csv\", header=None, index=None)`",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current code writes the trained RBM weights to a CSV file. CSV is a text-based format, which is not efficient for storing numerical data, especially large matrices. It lacks schema information, requires parsing, and does not support compression or predicate pushdown. Switching to a binary, columnar format like Parquet would significantly improve performance, reduce storage space, and enable faster reads.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\nspark = SparkSession(sc)\n\ndf = spark.createDataFrame(pd.DataFrame(result))\ndf.write.parquet(\"rbmWeights.parquet\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet offers several benefits:\n- **Faster Reads/Writes:** Parquet is a binary format, which is much faster to read and write than CSV, which requires parsing.\n- **Compression:** Parquet supports various compression algorithms, reducing storage space and I/O overhead.\n- **Schema Evolution:** Parquet stores schema information, allowing for schema evolution and better data management.\n- **Columnar Storage:** Parquet's columnar storage enables efficient retrieval of specific columns, which is beneficial for analytical queries.\n- **Predicate Pushdown:** Parquet supports predicate pushdown, allowing Spark to filter data at the storage layer, reducing the amount of data read into memory."
