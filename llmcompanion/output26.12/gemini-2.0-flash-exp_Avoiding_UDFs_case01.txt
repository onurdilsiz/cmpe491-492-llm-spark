      "operation": "sales_rdd.map(lambda line: line.split(\",\"))",
      "improvementExplanation": "The lambda function used in the map operation is a UDF that splits each line by a comma. This can be replaced by using Spark's built-in CSV parsing capabilities when reading the file as a DataFrame. This avoids the overhead of UDF serialization and allows Spark to optimize the parsing process.",

      "operation": "parsed_sales_rdd.filter(lambda sale: sale[2] == \"Electronics\")",
      "improvementExplanation": "The lambda function used in the filter operation is a UDF that filters the RDD based on the third element being equal to 'Electronics'. This can be replaced by using Spark's DataFrame API's filter method with a column expression. This avoids the overhead of UDF serialization and allows Spark to optimize the filtering process.",
