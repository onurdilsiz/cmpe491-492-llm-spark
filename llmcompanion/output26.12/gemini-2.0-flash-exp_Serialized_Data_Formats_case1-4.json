            "operation": "Reading text file from HDFS: `df1 = spark.read.text(\"hdfs://namenode/user/controller/ncdc-orig/2000-2018.txt\")`",
            "improvementExplanation": "The current code reads a text file. Text files are not optimized for analytical workloads. They lack schema information, require parsing, and are not compressed efficiently. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance, especially for large datasets, as Spark can leverage predicate pushdown and only read the necessary columns.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\ndf1 = spark.read.parquet(\"hdfs://namenode/user/controller/ncdc-orig/2000-2018.parquet\")\n# Assuming the data is already converted to parquet format. If not, you need to convert it first.\n# Example of converting the text file to parquet:\n# df1 = spark.read.text(\"hdfs://namenode/user/controller/ncdc-orig/2000-2018.txt\")\n# # ... (transformations to create df2 as in the original code)\n# df2.write.parquet(\"hdfs://namenode/user/controller/ncdc-orig/2000-2018.parquet\")\n```",
            "benefits": "Parquet offers faster reads due to columnar storage, efficient compression, and predicate pushdown, which allows Spark to skip irrelevant data during reads. This leads to significant performance gains, especially for large datasets and complex queries."

            "improvementExplanation": "The current code writes data in CSV format. While CSV is human-readable, it is not optimized for analytical processing. It lacks schema information, requires parsing, and is not as efficient as columnar formats like Parquet or ORC. Switching to Parquet or ORC would improve write performance, reduce storage space, and enable faster reads in subsequent operations.",

            "benefits": "Parquet provides faster writes, efficient compression, and schema evolution capabilities. It also enables faster reads in subsequent operations due to columnar storage and predicate pushdown. This leads to significant performance gains and reduced storage costs."
