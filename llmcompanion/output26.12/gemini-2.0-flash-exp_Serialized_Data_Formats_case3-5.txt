      "operation": "Reading from CSV file: `stations = sc.textFile(\"BDA/input/stations.csv\")`",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads station data from a CSV file. CSV is a row-based format, which is not efficient for analytical queries. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance, especially when only a subset of columns is needed. Parquet also supports schema evolution and predicate pushdown, which can further optimize queries.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nstations = spark.read.csv(\"BDA/input/stations.csv\", sep=\";\", header=False, inferSchema=True)\nstations = stations.select(\"_c0\", \"_c3\", \"_c4\").toDF(\"station_id\", \"latitude\", \"longitude\")\nstations.write.parquet(\"BDA/input/stations.parquet\", mode=\"overwrite\")\nstations = spark.read.parquet(\"BDA/input/stations.parquet\")\nstations = stations.rdd.map(lambda x: (x.station_id, (float(x.latitude), float(x.longitude))))\n```",
      "benefits": "Faster reads due to columnar storage, schema evolution support, predicate pushdown for query optimization, and better compression."

      "operation": "Reading from CSV file: `temps = sc.textFile(\"BDA/input/temperature-readings.csv\")`",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads temperature data from a CSV file. Similar to the stations data, CSV is inefficient for analytical workloads. Using Parquet or ORC would provide significant performance gains. Parquet's columnar storage allows Spark to read only the necessary columns, and its compression capabilities reduce storage space and I/O overhead. Predicate pushdown can also be used to filter data at the storage layer, reducing the amount of data that needs to be read into memory.",
