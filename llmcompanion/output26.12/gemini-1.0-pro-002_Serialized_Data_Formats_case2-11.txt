      "operation": "Reading JSON data from 'links.json' file (line 1)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Reading JSON data from a file can be slow and inefficient, especially for large datasets. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve read performance due to their optimized data structures and compression capabilities.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nimport pyspark.sql.functions as F\n\ndf = spark.read.parquet('s3a://your-bucket/links.parquet')\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC will provide faster read performance, better compression, and support for predicate pushdown, which can further optimize query execution."

      "operation": "Writing DataFrame to Parquet file (line 74)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Writing data to Parquet format offers several advantages over other formats like CSV or JSON. Parquet provides efficient data storage, compression, and columnar organization, leading to faster read/write operations and improved query performance.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\ndf_transformed.write.mode('overwrite').parquet(output_path)\n```",
      "benefits": "Using Parquet will result in faster write performance, efficient data storage, and improved query optimization through columnar organization and predicate pushdown."
