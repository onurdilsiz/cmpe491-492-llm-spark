            "operation": "repartitioned_df = transactions_df.repartition(10)",
            "improvementExplanation": "In this case, repartition(10) is used unnecessarily on the DataFrame 'transactions_df', causing a full shuffle to create 10 partitions. Since the goal is to reduce the number of partitions without a full shuffle, coalesce() can be used instead.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "coalesced_df = transactions_df.coalesce(5)",
            "benefits": "By replacing repartition(10) with coalesce(5), the DataFrame will be efficiently reduced to 5 partitions without triggering a full shuffle. This change can lead to improved resource usage, reduced shuffling, and faster job runtime."
