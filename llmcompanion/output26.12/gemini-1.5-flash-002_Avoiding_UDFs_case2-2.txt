    {
      "operation": "getMSDiff(diff) and getMS(start, stop) (lines 80-89)",
      "improvementExplanation": "These functions perform simple arithmetic operations on datetime objects.  Spark's built-in functions can handle these calculations efficiently without the overhead of UDFs.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "Replace with direct calculations using datetime properties and arithmetic operations within the main Spark code.  For example, `diff.total_seconds() * 1000` can replace `getMSDiff(diff)`.",
      "benefits": "Avoids the overhead of UDF serialization and execution, enabling Spark's optimized execution plan."
    },
    {
      "operation": "saveFactorMatrices(partition) (lines 92-116)",
      "improvementExplanation": "This UDF performs file I/O and NumPy operations.  Spark's built-in functions are not designed for direct file system interaction within a distributed environment. However, the core computation can be optimized.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "Separate file I/O from the core computation. Perform the NumPy operations using Spark's built-in functions where possible.  Use `coalesce(1)` before saving to write to a single file.",
      "benefits": "Improves performance by avoiding the overhead of UDF serialization and execution, and by separating file I/O from computation."
    },
    {
      "operation": "initializeArms(n,mean) (lines 120-138)",
      "improvementExplanation": "This function initializes a list of NormalGamma objects. This initialization logic can be done outside the Spark execution.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "Move the initialization logic outside the Spark operations. Create the `mabArms` and `mabRates` lists before the Spark job starts.",
      "benefits": "Reduces the overhead of UDF execution by performing the initialization once instead of on each executor."
    },
    {
      "operation": "initializeMWU(n) (lines 141-163)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to `initializeArms`, this function initializes a list of MWU objects. This can be done outside Spark.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "Move the initialization of `mabArms` and `mabRates` lists outside the Spark job.",
      "benefits": "Avoids unnecessary UDF calls and improves performance."
    },
    {
      "operation": "getTensorDimensions(partition) (lines 166-174)",
      "improvementExplanation": "This UDF calculates tensor dimensions and norms.  Spark's built-in functions can efficiently compute these statistics.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "Use Spark's `agg` function with `sum`, `count`, and `avg` to calculate the statistics directly on the DataFrame/Dataset.",
      "benefits": "Enables Catalyst optimizations and improves performance by avoiding UDF serialization and execution."
    },
    {
      "operation": "initializeData(partition) (lines 177-187)",
      "improvementExplanation": "This UDF loads NumPy arrays from binary data.  While Spark can't directly handle NumPy arrays, the file loading can be optimized.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "Use Spark's `map` function with a lambda function to load the data. Consider using a more efficient binary data format if possible.",
      "benefits": "Improves performance by avoiding the overhead of UDF serialization and execution."
    },
    {
      "operation": "updateSketchingRate(sketchingRate, errDelta, step) (lines 190-216)",
      "improvementExplanation": "This function implements a simple conditional update. This logic can be directly incorporated into the main Spark code.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "Replace with a conditional expression within the main loop of the Spark job.",
      "benefits": "Avoids the overhead of UDF calls and improves readability."
    },
    {
      "operation": "singleModeALSstep(partition) (lines 219-380)",
      "improvementExplanation": "This UDF performs a significant portion of the ALS computation.  While some parts might be difficult to replace directly, many operations can be optimized using Spark's built-in functions.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "Break down the UDF into smaller, more manageable functions.  Use Spark's linear algebra functions and matrix operations wherever possible.  Consider using Spark's MLlib library for more optimized linear algebra operations.",
      "benefits": "Enables Catalyst optimizations, improves performance by reducing serialization overhead, and allows for parallel processing of matrix operations."
