            "improvementExplanation": "The map() transformation is used to explode the paths in the DataFrame. This operation can be performed more efficiently at the partition level using mapPartitions() to reduce function call overhead.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "explodedPaths = csvDF.rdd.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: (row for path in iterator for row in [(path, ) for path in splitPaths(path[0])])).toDF([\"Path\"])",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() can optimize the operation by processing multiple rows within a partition at once, reducing the overhead of calling the function for each row individually. This can lead to improved performance, especially for I/O-heavy operations like splitting paths."
