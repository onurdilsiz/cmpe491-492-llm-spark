            "improvementExplanation": "This map operation converts each line of the input file (a string) into a list of floats. This operation is performed independently on each element and doesn't require inter-element communication.  Therefore, it's a good candidate for mapPartitions. Processing a partition's lines together can reduce the overhead of repeatedly calling the lambda function for each line.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "inputPoints = rawData.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: ([[float(i) for i in line.split(',')] for line in iterator]))",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions reduces the function call overhead by processing multiple lines within a single function call. This leads to improved performance, especially for large datasets."

            "operation": "Line 86: outlierCells = cells_counts.map(region_counts7).filter(lambda x: x[1] <= M).collectAsMap()",
            "improvementExplanation": "This map operation applies the `region_counts7` function to each element of the `cells_counts` RDD.  The `region_counts7` function accesses the `cells_counts_dict`, which is a dictionary created from the RDD.  Since `cells_counts_dict` is collected in memory on the driver, the map operation can be performed locally within each partition without needing inter-partition communication.  Therefore, using mapPartitions would not provide significant performance gains in this case. The overhead of serializing and deserializing the `cells_counts_dict` might outweigh the benefits of mapPartitions.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "No significant performance improvement expected by using mapPartitions.  The current implementation is likely efficient enough.",
            "benefits": "No significant benefits are expected from switching to mapPartitions in this specific case. The overhead of data transfer might outweigh the benefits."

            "improvementExplanation": "This map operation calculates the minimum distance from each point to the nearest center.  The centers are broadcast, so each partition has a local copy. The operation is independent for each point.  Using mapPartitions would allow for batch processing of distance calculations within each partition, reducing the overhead of repeatedly calling the lambda function for each point.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "FarthestPoint = P.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: [min(math.dist(point, center) for center in broadcast_C.value) for point in iterator]).reduce(max)",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions reduces the function call overhead and improves performance by processing multiple points within a single function call per partition. This is particularly beneficial for large datasets."
