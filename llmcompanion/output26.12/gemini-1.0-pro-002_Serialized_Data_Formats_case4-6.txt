**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any explicit input/output operations. It defines several user-defined functions (UDFs) for data transformation and cleaning, but these functions do not directly read or write data from external sources. Therefore, there are no opportunities to optimize input/output operations by switching to serialized data formats like Parquet or ORC.

**Additional Notes:**

* While the provided code does not perform input/output operations, it is important to consider data serialization when working with Spark DataFrames. Serialized formats like Parquet and ORC offer significant performance benefits for reading and writing data, as well as query optimization through predicate pushdown.
* If the Spark application were to read or write data from external sources, it would be beneficial to use serialized formats like Parquet or ORC to improve performance.
* The provided UDFs can be used within Spark DataFrames to transform and clean data before writing it to external storage in a serialized format.
