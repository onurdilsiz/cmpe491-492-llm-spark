            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from HBase using the `TableInputFormat`.  While efficient for HBase, the data is likely processed as JSON strings.  Switching to Parquet or ORC would allow for columnar storage and efficient serialization, leading to faster reads and processing.  This requires pre-processing the data into Parquet or ORC format before loading into Spark.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "This requires a change in the data pipeline.  Before Spark processing, the data needs to be exported from HBase and saved as Parquet or ORC files in HDFS. Then, the Spark code would read from these files using `spark.read.parquet()` or `spark.read.orc()`.  Example:\n```python\nparquet_path = '/path/to/parquet/data'\ndata_df = spark.read.parquet(parquet_path)\n# ... rest of the Spark processing\n```",
            "benefits": "Faster read speeds, improved compression, potential for predicate pushdown optimization leading to faster query execution."

            "improvementExplanation": "The code writes data to HBase using `MultiTableOutputFormat` and `TableOutputFormat`. The data is written as strings.  Switching to Parquet or ORC would allow for efficient storage in HDFS, which can then be imported into HBase if needed. This would improve write performance and reduce storage space.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "Instead of writing directly to HBase, write the RDD to Parquet or ORC files in HDFS.  Then, use a separate HBase import job to load the data from the optimized files into HBase.  Example:\n```python\nparquet_path = '/path/to/parquet/data'\nrdd.saveAsParquetFile(parquet_path)\n# ... separate HBase import job\n```",
