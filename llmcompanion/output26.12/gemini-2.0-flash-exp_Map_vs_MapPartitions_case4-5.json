            "operation": "df.rdd.collect() in `write_to_protobuf` function",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `collect()` operation brings all the data from the distributed RDD to the driver node, which can be inefficient for large datasets. The subsequent loop iterates over each row, which can be optimized by processing each partition in parallel using `mapPartitions`. Instead of collecting all rows and then iterating, we can process each partition independently, reducing the load on the driver and enabling parallel processing of the protobuf serialization.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\ndef write_to_protobuf_map_partitions(df, path, print_intervals=1000):\n    t_start = time.time()\n    def process_partition(partition):\n        with open(path, \"ab\") as f:\n            for i, row in enumerate(partition):\n                page_message = page_pb2.PageMessage()\n                page_message.idx = row[0]\n                page_message.chunk = row[1]\n                page_message.page_id = row[2]\n                page_message.page_name = row[3]\n                page_message.page = pickle.dumps(pickle.loads(row[4]))\n                page_message.synthetic_paragraphs = pickle.dumps(pickle.loads(row[5])[0])\n                page_message.synthetic_skeleton = pickle.dumps(pickle.loads(row[5])[1])\n\n                bytesAsString = page_message.SerializeToString()\n                f.write(bytesAsString)\n\n                if (i % print_intervals == 0):\n                    print(\"written row {} - page_id={} (time = {})\".format(i, row[0], time.time()-t_start))\n        return []\n\n    df.rdd.mapPartitions(process_partition).collect()\n    print('FINISHED in {}'.format(time.time()-t_start))\n```\n\nThis replaces the original `write_to_protobuf` function with `write_to_protobuf_map_partitions`. The key change is using `df.rdd.mapPartitions(process_partition)` instead of `df.rdd.collect()` and iterating over the collected rows. The `process_partition` function now handles the serialization and writing to the file for each partition. The file is opened in append mode (`\"ab\"`) to allow multiple partitions to write to the same file concurrently. The final `.collect()` is still needed to trigger the execution of the mapPartitions operation, but it collects an empty list from each partition, so it doesn't bring the entire dataset to the driver.",
            "benefits": "By using `mapPartitions`, we avoid collecting all the data to the driver node, which can cause memory issues and slow down the process. The serialization and writing to the file are now done in parallel for each partition, which can significantly improve performance. This approach also reduces the overhead of function calls, as the `process_partition` function is called once per partition instead of once per row. Additionally, opening the file in append mode allows for concurrent writing from different partitions, further optimizing I/O operations."
