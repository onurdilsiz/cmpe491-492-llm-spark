```json
{
  "detected": false,
  "occurrences": 0,
  "response": []
}
```

## Explanation

The provided Spark code does not contain any user-defined functions (UDFs). Therefore, the `detected` field is set to `false`, and the `occurrences` field is set to `0`. The `response` array is empty because there are no UDFs to analyze.

## Benefits of Avoiding UDFs

While this specific code example does not use UDFs, it is still important to understand the benefits of avoiding them whenever possible. Here are some key advantages:

* **Catalyst Optimizations:** UDFs prevent Catalyst, Spark's query optimizer, from optimizing the execution plan. This can lead to suboptimal performance, especially for complex queries.
* **Performance Improvement:** UDFs introduce serialization overhead, as they need to be transferred between the driver and executors. This can significantly impact performance, especially for large datasets.
* **Reduced Complexity:** UDFs add complexity to the code, making it harder to understand, maintain, and debug.

## Conclusion

By avoiding UDFs and utilizing built-in functions and native DataFrame/Dataset operations, you can achieve better performance, improved code maintainability, and more efficient query execution.
