            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a CSV file, which is not an optimized format for Spark. CSV files are text-based, lack schema information, and are not easily splittable, leading to slower read times and limited query optimization. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet, ORC, or Avro can significantly improve performance.",

            "benefits": "Using Parquet (or ORC/Avro) provides benefits such as faster read/write speeds due to binary format, schema storage within the file, compression, and predicate pushdown for query optimization. This leads to reduced I/O and faster job execution."
