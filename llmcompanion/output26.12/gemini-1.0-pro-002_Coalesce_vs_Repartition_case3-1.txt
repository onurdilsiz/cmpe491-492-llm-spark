      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition(100)` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame. However, since the subsequent operations do not require a full shuffle, using `coalesce(100)` instead would achieve the same result without incurring the overhead of a full shuffle. This would improve resource usage and potentially lead to faster job runtime.",
