    {
      "operation": "Line 106: df = df.repartition(1000)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(1000) operation performs a full shuffle, which is expensive. Since the data is already sorted, using coalesce(1) is sufficient to reduce the number of partitions to 1 without shuffling.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "df = df.sort(asc('time')).coalesce(1)",

      "operation": "Lines 88-90: s3.Bucket(raw_data_bucket).download_file(file_name, 'tmp.nc')\ndata = iris.load('tmp.nc')",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code downloads the NETCDF file and then loads it into memory using iris.  This is inefficient for large files.  Instead, the data should be read directly from S3 in a distributed manner using a Spark-compatible format like Parquet.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "This requires significant code restructuring.  The process_netcdf function would need to be rewritten to read the data directly from S3 using Spark's built-in S3 support and a Parquet file.  The iris library would no longer be used for data loading.  A sample snippet for reading Parquet from S3 is: \nspark.read.parquet(\"s3a://{raw_data_bucket}/{file_name}\")",
      "benefits": "Faster reads, better scalability, and avoids the need to download the entire file to the driver node."

      "improvementExplanation": "The utc_timestamp function is a UDF.  This can be replaced with Spark SQL's built-in date/time functions.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "Replace the call to utc_timestamp with Spark SQL functions.  For example, instead of:\ntime = utc_timestamp(time)\nUse:\ntime = from_unixtime(time * 60 * 60).cast(\"string\")",
      "benefits": "Enables Catalyst optimizations, improves performance, and reduces serialization overhead."
