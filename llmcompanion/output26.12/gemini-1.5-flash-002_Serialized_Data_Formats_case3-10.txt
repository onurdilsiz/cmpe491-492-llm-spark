    {
      "operation": "pd.read_csv(\"airport-data.csv\") on line 40",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a CSV file using pandas.  CSV is a text-based format, leading to slower read times and larger file sizes compared to binary formats like Parquet or ORC.  Parquet and ORC offer better compression, columnar storage, and support for predicate pushdown, resulting in significantly faster query performance, especially for large datasets.  Switching to Parquet or ORC would eliminate the need for pandas and allow Spark to directly read and process the data.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName('airport').getOrCreate()\ndf = spark.read.parquet(\"airport-data.parquet\") # Or .orc(\"airport-data.orc\")",
      "benefits": "Faster read speeds, reduced storage space due to compression, and improved query performance through features like predicate pushdown and columnar storage."

    {
      "operation": "Saving the model and indexer to disk using PipelineModel.load('airport-index/') and PipelineModel.load('airport-shiz/') on lines 36 and 37",
      "improvementExplanation": "While not explicitly shown as reading from a file, the loading of the model and indexer implicitly involves reading from disk.  The format of these saved models is not specified, but assuming it's not a binary format, switching to a more efficient format would improve loading times.  While Parquet and ORC are primarily for tabular data, other binary formats suitable for model persistence could be used for faster loading.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "No direct equivalent provided as the model format is unknown.  Consider saving models using a format like PMML or a custom binary format for faster loading.  Example using joblib (for demonstration, not directly applicable to Spark):\nfrom joblib import dump, load\ndump(model, 'airport-shiz.joblib')\nloaded_model = load('airport-shiz.joblib')",
      "benefits": "Faster model loading times, reduced storage space (potentially)."
