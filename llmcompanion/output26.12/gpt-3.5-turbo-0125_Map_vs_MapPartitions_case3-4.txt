            "improvementExplanation": "The map() transformation is used to select specific columns from the DataFrame df_trip. Since this operation can be performed at the partition level without the need to process each individual row, it is more efficient to use mapPartitions() for better performance.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "df_trip = df_trip.rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: (row[1:3] for row in partition)).toDF(['dispatching_base_num', 'originating_base_num'])",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() reduces the function call overhead by processing data at the partition level, leading to optimized I/O operations and improved performance for column selection tasks."
