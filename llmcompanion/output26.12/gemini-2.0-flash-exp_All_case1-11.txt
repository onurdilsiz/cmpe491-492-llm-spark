    {
      "operation": "df = df.repartition(1000)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition(1000)` operation forces a full shuffle of the data, which can be expensive. Since the subsequent operation is `coalesce(1)`, which reduces the number of partitions, we can directly use `coalesce(1)` to reduce the number of partitions to 1 without the full shuffle. If the goal is to reduce the number of partitions, `coalesce` is more efficient than `repartition`.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "df = df.coalesce(1)",
      "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce(1)` avoids the full shuffle caused by `repartition(1000)`, leading to reduced shuffling, improved resource usage, and faster job runtime. It directly reduces the number of partitions to 1, which is the desired outcome."

      "operation": "s3.Bucket(raw_data_bucket).download_file(file_name, 'tmp.nc')",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code downloads a NetCDF file to the local disk and then loads it using `iris.load('tmp.nc')`. While NetCDF is a binary format, it's not optimized for Spark's distributed processing. Instead, we should convert the NetCDF data to a columnar format like Parquet, ORC, or Avro, which are optimized for Spark. This would involve reading the NetCDF data, converting it to a DataFrame, and then writing it to an optimized format. However, the provided code does not include the writing part, so the improvement would be to write the data to an optimized format after creating the dataframe.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "df.write.parquet(output_path)",
      "benefits": "Using Parquet, ORC, or Avro would enable faster reads/writes, compression, and query optimization through predicate pushdown. This would significantly improve the performance of subsequent Spark jobs that process this data. Additionally, it would eliminate the need to download the file to the local disk."

    {
      "operation": "utc_timestamp(hours_since_first_epoch)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `utc_timestamp` function is a UDF that converts hours since the epoch to a timestamp string. This can be replaced with Spark's built-in date and time functions, which are optimized and avoid the overhead of UDFs. We can use `from_unixtime` to convert the epoch to a timestamp and then format it using `date_format`.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "from_unixtime(col('hours_since_first_epoch') * 60 * 60).cast('timestamp')",
      "benefits": "Avoiding UDFs enables Catalyst optimizations, improves performance, and reduces serialization overhead. Spark's built-in functions are generally more efficient and optimized than user-defined functions."
