            "improvementExplanation": "The create_feature_dataframe() function uses map() to iterate over elements in a nested loop structure to process data at the element level. This operation can be more efficiently performed at the partition level using mapPartitions() to reduce function call overhead and improve performance.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "df = rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: create_feature_dataframe_partition(partition, feature, feature_dtype_mapping, feature_index_mapping, dim_set))",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() allows processing data at the partition level, reducing function call overhead and potentially optimizing I/O operations. This can lead to improved performance and resource utilization, especially for partition-level operations."
