      "operation": "Reading pickled data from a URL using `urllib2.urlopen(request).read()` in `get_server_weights` function.",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current implementation uses pickle to serialize and deserialize data over HTTP. While pickle is convenient for Python objects, it's not optimized for large datasets or cross-language compatibility. Switching to a more efficient format like Parquet or ORC would improve performance, especially for large weight matrices, by providing better compression and faster read/write speeds. However, this would require changes on both the server and client side to handle the new format. Since this is a network operation, the performance gain might be less significant than local file I/O, but it's still worth considering for large models.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "This operation is part of a network request and cannot be directly replaced with a file format like Parquet or ORC. The server would need to serialize the weights to a format like Parquet and send it as a byte stream, and the client would need to deserialize it. This would require significant changes to the server and client code, and is not a simple replacement. The current implementation is using pickle, which is not ideal for large datasets or cross-language compatibility. A better approach would be to use a more efficient serialization format like Protocol Buffers or Apache Avro, which are designed for network communication and can be more efficient than pickle. However, this is beyond the scope of a simple replacement with Parquet or ORC.",
      "benefits": "Switching to a more efficient serialization format like Protocol Buffers or Apache Avro would provide faster serialization and deserialization, smaller data sizes, and better cross-language compatibility. However, this is not a direct replacement with Parquet or ORC, which are designed for file storage and not network communication."

If the weights are large, using a more efficient serialization format like Parquet or ORC could improve performance.
