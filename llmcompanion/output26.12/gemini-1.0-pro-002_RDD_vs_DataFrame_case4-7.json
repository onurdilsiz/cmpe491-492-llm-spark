            "improvementExplanation": "The ApplyMapping operation can be replaced with a DataFrame/Dataset transformation for improved performance and scalability. DataFrames/Datasets offer optimized query execution plans and reduced shuffling compared to RDDs.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\n# Convert the RDD to a DataFrame\nApplyMapping_df = ApplyMapping_node2.toDF()\n\n# Perform the mapping using DataFrame transformations\nApplyMapping_df = ApplyMapping_df.withColumn(\"time\", MAP_TIME(col('time')).cast('integer'))\nApplyMapping_df = ApplyMapping_df.withColumn(\"severity_id\", MAP_SEVID(col('severity')).cast('integer'))\n# ... (other transformations)\n\n# Write the DataFrame to S3\nApplyMapping_df.write.parquet(S3bucket_node3_path, compression=\"gzip\", partitionBy=[])\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to DataFrame/Dataset for the ApplyMapping operation will provide the following benefits:\n\n* **Improved performance:** DataFrames/Datasets leverage Spark's Catalyst Optimizer for efficient query execution plans, leading to faster processing times.\n* **Reduced shuffling:** DataFrames/Datasets minimize data shuffling between partitions, resulting in better resource utilization and reduced network overhead.\n* **Simplified code:** DataFrame/Dataset transformations offer a more concise and readable syntax compared to RDD operations."
