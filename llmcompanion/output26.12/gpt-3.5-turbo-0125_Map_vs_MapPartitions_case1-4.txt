            "operation": "df1.withColumn()",
            "improvementExplanation": "The withColumn() transformation is applied row by row using map(), which can lead to high function call overhead. By using mapPartitions(), the transformation can be performed at the partition level, reducing the number of function calls and improving efficiency, especially for I/O-heavy operations.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "df2 = df1.rdd.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: ([Row(Weather_Station=row[0], WBAN=row[1], Observation_Date=row[2], Observation_Hour=row[3], Latitude=row[4], Longitude=row[5], Elevation=row[6], Wind_Direction=row[7], WD_Quality_Code=row[8], Sky_Ceiling_Height=row[9], SC_Quality_Code=row[10], Visibility_Distance=row[11], VD_Quality_Code=row[12], Air_Temperature=row[13], AT_Quality_Code=row[14], Dew_Point=row[15], DP_Quality_Code=row[16], Atmospheric_Pressure=row[17], AP_Quality_Code=row[18]) for row in iterator])",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() reduces function call overhead by processing multiple rows at once within each partition. This optimization can lead to improved performance, especially for operations that involve heavy computations or I/O operations."
