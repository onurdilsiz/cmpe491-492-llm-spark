            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame to 50. This is likely done to improve parallelism and potentially speed up subsequent operations. However, in this case, the DataFrame is already partitioned by date, which is likely sufficient for parallelism. Additionally, the `repartition()` operation requires a full shuffle, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, it may be more efficient to use `coalesce()` instead, which only reduces the number of partitions without shuffling the data.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df_5years.coalesce(50)",
            "benefits": "Replacing `repartition()` with `coalesce()` in this case would avoid the need for a full shuffle, reducing the overall job runtime and improving resource utilization. This is because the data is already partitioned by date, so reducing the number of partitions will not significantly impact parallelism."
