            "operation": "repartitioned_df = sales_df.repartition(10)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The code uses `repartition(10)` to increase the number of partitions to 10.  Since the initial DataFrame likely has a small number of partitions (default or based on the number of cores), using `repartition` will trigger a full shuffle, even though the target number of partitions is not significantly larger.  If the goal is simply to adjust the number of partitions downwards, `coalesce` would be more efficient as it avoids the full shuffle and only performs local operations.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "If the initial number of partitions is greater than 10, this operation is not needed. If the initial number of partitions is less than 10 and the goal is to increase the number of partitions to 10, `repartition` is still necessary. If the goal is to reduce the number of partitions to a number less than or equal to the initial number of partitions, then `coalesce` can be used. For example, to reduce the number of partitions to 5 (assuming the initial number of partitions is greater than 5):\n`coalesced_df = sales_df.coalesce(5)`",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce` when reducing the number of partitions avoids a full data shuffle, resulting in significantly reduced execution time and resource consumption.  This is because `coalesce` attempts to redistribute data locally without a full shuffle, making it much more efficient than `repartition` in this scenario."
