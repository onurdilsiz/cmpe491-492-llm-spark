            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used here to increase the number of partitions for the RDD. However, in this context, the operation does not require a full shuffle as it is just redistributing data across partitions. Using coalesce() instead of repartition() can efficiently reduce the number of partitions without performing a full shuffle.",

            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() will reduce unnecessary shuffling, leading to improved resource usage and faster job runtime."
