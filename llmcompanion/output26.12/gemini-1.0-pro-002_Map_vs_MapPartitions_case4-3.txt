      "operation": "df.select(five_udf()).display()",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `five_udf` function simply returns a constant value (5). This operation can be performed more efficiently using `mapPartitions` because it avoids unnecessary function calls for each element in the DataFrame. By applying the function to each partition instead of each individual element, we can significantly reduce the overhead and improve performance.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\ndef five_partitioned(iterator):\n    for _ in iterator:\n        yield 5\n\ndf.rdd.mapPartitions(five_partitioned).toDF().show()\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to `mapPartitions` in this case offers several benefits:\n- **Reduced function call overhead:** Instead of calling the `five_udf` function for each element, we only call it once for each partition, significantly reducing the number of function calls.\n- **Optimized I/O:** By processing data in batches at the partition level, we can potentially optimize I/O operations and improve data transfer efficiency.\n- **Improved resource utilization:** By reducing the number of function calls and optimizing I/O, we can improve the overall resource utilization and potentially achieve better performance."

      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the previous case, the `five` function simply returns a constant value (5). Using `mapPartitions` to apply this function at the partition level can significantly improve performance by reducing function call overhead and optimizing I/O.",

      "benefits": "The benefits of switching to `mapPartitions` in this case are the same as those described for the previous operation: reduced function call overhead, optimized I/O, and improved resource utilization."
