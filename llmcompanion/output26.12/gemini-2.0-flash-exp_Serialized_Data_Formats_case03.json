            "operation": "Reading from text file using `spark.sparkContext.textFile(\"path/to/employees.txt\")`",
            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads employee data from a plain text file. This is inefficient because Spark has to parse the text data on each read. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance, as these formats are optimized for analytical queries and support schema evolution and predicate pushdown.",

            "benefits": "Faster reads due to columnar storage, schema evolution support, predicate pushdown for query optimization, and compression."

            "improvementExplanation": "The code writes the department and salary data to a CSV file. CSV is a row-based format and is not optimized for analytical workloads. Writing to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would be more efficient, especially for large datasets, as it allows for better compression and faster reads when the data is used in subsequent Spark jobs.",
