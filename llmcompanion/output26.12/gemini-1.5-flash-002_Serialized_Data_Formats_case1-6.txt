    {
      "operation": "Reading text data from HDFS using `spark.read.text()` at line 14.",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a text file, which is inefficient for large datasets.  Switching to Parquet or ORC would significantly improve performance due to their columnar storage and compression capabilities.  Parquet, in particular, offers better schema enforcement and handling of complex data types.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "parquet_df = spark.read.parquet(\"hdfs://namenode/user/controller/ncdc-orig/2000-2018.parquet\")\n# Note: This assumes the data has been pre-processed and saved as a Parquet file.  The conversion would involve writing the data to Parquet before this step.",
      "benefits": "Faster read speeds, better compression, and improved query performance due to predicate pushdown and columnar storage."
    },
    {
      "operation": "Writing data to CSV in HDFS using `df_5years.repartition(200).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").mode(\"overwrite\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000-2005/repartition/200\")` at lines 50-52.",
      "improvementExplanation": "While the code uses LZ4 compression for CSV, Parquet or ORC offer superior compression and performance.  These formats are columnar, enabling faster query execution by only reading necessary columns.  They also support efficient predicate pushdown, filtering data before reading it into memory.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "df_5years.repartition(200).write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000-2005/repartition/200\")",
      "benefits": "Significantly faster write speeds, better compression (than LZ4 on CSV), improved query performance due to columnar storage and predicate pushdown, and better schema enforcement."
