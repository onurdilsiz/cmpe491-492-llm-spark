    {
      "operation": "Reading from 'links.json' using `with open(\"links.json\", 'r') as f: master_dump = json.loads(f.read())`",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads a JSON file ('links.json') into memory. While JSON is human-readable, it's not efficient for large datasets due to its text-based nature and lack of schema enforcement. Switching to a binary, columnar format like Parquet would significantly improve read performance, especially if the file is large. Parquet also supports schema evolution and predicate pushdown, which can further optimize queries.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming 'links.json' can be converted to a DataFrame\n# If the JSON is a list of objects, this will work\nlinks_df = pd.read_json('links.json')\n\n# Save as Parquet\nlinks_df.to_parquet('links.parquet', index=False)\n\n# Load Parquet file in Spark\nlinks_df_spark = spark.read.parquet('links.parquet')\n\n# Use links_df_spark instead of master_dump\n# Example: Extract distinct buckets from the Spark DataFrame\ndistinct_buckets = links_df_spark.selectExpr('explode(map_values(element_at(array_values(transform(array_values(map_values(struct(*))), x -> map_keys(x))), 1)))').distinct().rdd.flatMap(lambda x: x).collect()\n\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet provides faster read times due to its columnar storage and binary format. It also offers compression, reducing storage space and I/O overhead. Additionally, Parquet supports schema evolution and predicate pushdown, which can improve query performance."

      "operation": "Reading from S3 using `s3.get_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key_)` within `process_partition` function",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code fetches data from S3 using boto3, which is a general-purpose S3 client. While this works, it doesn't leverage Spark's optimized data loading capabilities. If the data in S3 were stored in a columnar format like Parquet or ORC, Spark could directly read it in parallel, significantly improving performance. Currently, the code reads the entire object into memory, which can be inefficient for large files. The code also parses the WARC format, which is not optimized for analytical queries. If the data was pre-processed and stored in Parquet, the parsing step could be avoided.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Assuming the data in S3 is already in Parquet format\n# If not, you would need to pre-process the WARC files and save them as Parquet\n\ndef process_partition_optimized(uris):\n    # Assuming uris are S3 paths to Parquet files\n    df_list = []\n    for uri in uris:\n        try:\n            df = spark.read.parquet(uri)\n            df_list.append(df)\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"Error reading {uri}: {e}\")\n            continue\n    if df_list:\n        return reduce(DataFrame.unionAll, df_list)\n    else:\n        return spark.createDataFrame([], schema=StructType([]))\n\n\nprint(\"[+] extracting core data\")\nuri_rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(distinct_buckets, numSlices=len(distinct_buckets))\n# Assuming distinct_buckets now contains S3 paths to Parquet files\ndf = uri_rdd.mapPartitions(process_partition_optimized).toDF()\n\n```",
      "benefits": "Reading Parquet files directly with Spark is much faster than fetching raw data from S3 and parsing it. Parquet's columnar format allows Spark to read only the necessary columns, and its binary format is more efficient than text-based formats. Additionally, Parquet supports predicate pushdown, which can further optimize queries by filtering data at the storage layer."

      "operation": "Writing to S3 as Parquet using `df_transformed.write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(output_path)`",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code already writes the final DataFrame to Parquet format, which is good. No change is needed here. This is the correct approach for storing the processed data for future use.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# No change needed, the code is already using Parquet\nprint(\"[+] writing to s3\")\noutput_path = \"s3a://ai-crap/data/nasdaq.parquet\"\ndf_transformed.write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(output_path)\n```",
      "benefits": "Parquet is a highly efficient format for storing large datasets. It provides columnar storage, which allows for faster reads of specific columns, and it supports compression, which reduces storage space and I/O overhead. It also supports schema evolution and predicate pushdown, which can improve query performance."
