      "improvementExplanation": "While the code uses `toDF` to convert the result of `csv` to a DataFrame, the underlying reading of the CSV file is still done using RDDs.  This can be improved by directly reading the CSV into a DataFrame using Spark's optimized CSV reader.",

      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition(1)` operation is used before writing to Parquet. Since the goal is to write to a single partition, `coalesce` is more efficient as it avoids unnecessary shuffling.",

      "benefits": "Using `coalesce` instead of `repartition` reduces the amount of data shuffled, leading to faster execution and improved resource utilization.  `coalesce` only performs a data movement if the number of partitions is reduced, while `repartition` always performs a full shuffle."
