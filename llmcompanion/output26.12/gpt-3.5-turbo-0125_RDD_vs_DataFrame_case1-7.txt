            "improvementExplanation": "The collect operation brings all the data to the driver, which can be inefficient for large datasets. It can lead to driver memory issues and slow performance.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "number_of_files = agg_df.agg({'_num': 'max'}).collect()[0]['max(_num)']",
            "benefits": "By using the agg function directly on the DataFrame and then collecting only the aggregated result, we avoid bringing all the data to the driver. This reduces memory pressure on the driver and improves performance for large datasets."
