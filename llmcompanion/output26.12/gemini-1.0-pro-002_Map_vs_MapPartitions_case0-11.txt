      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation creates key-value pairs of (movie_id, 1) for counting occurrences. Since we are only interested in the movie_id and not the entire rating record, we can perform this transformation at the partition level using mapPartitions(). This can reduce function call overhead and improve performance, especially for large datasets.",
