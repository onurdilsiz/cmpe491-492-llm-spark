            "improvementExplanation": "The current operation reads a CSV file from HDFS, which is a text-based format. This can be inefficient for large datasets due to the overhead of parsing and deserializing the data. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\ncsvDF = spark.read.parquet(hdfs_path_to_csv)\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC will provide the following benefits:\n* **Faster reads/writes:** Serialized formats like Parquet and ORC are optimized for efficient data storage and retrieval, resulting in faster read and write operations.\n* **Compression:** These formats support compression, which can significantly reduce the storage space required for the data.\n* **Query optimization:** Parquet and ORC allow for predicate pushdown, which enables queries to filter data at the file level before reading the entire dataset, further improving performance."
