            "improvementExplanation": "The current data format being used is CSV, which is not optimized for performance due to its textual nature and lack of built-in optimizations like predicate pushdown. Switching to a columnar storage format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve read/write performance, compression, and query optimization.",
