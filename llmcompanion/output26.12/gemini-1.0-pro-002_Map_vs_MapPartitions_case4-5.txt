      "improvementExplanation": "The map() operation on line 104 iterates over each row in the DataFrame and applies the `synthetic_page_skeleton_and_paragraphs_udf` function to the `page_bytearray` column. This operation involves deserializing the bytearray, processing it with the UDF, and then serializing the result back into a bytearray. This can be inefficient, especially if the UDF involves I/O-heavy operations or complex computations. By using mapPartitions() instead, we can process the data in batches, reducing the number of function calls and improving I/O efficiency.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "df = df.rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: map(lambda row: row.withColumn(\"synthetic_entity_linking\", synthetic_page_skeleton_and_paragraphs_udf(row[\"page_bytearray\"]))))",
      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() in this case can provide several benefits:\n\n* **Reduced function call overhead:** By processing the data in batches, we can reduce the number of times the UDF is called, which can improve performance.\n* **Optimized I/O:** If the UDF involves I/O operations, processing the data in batches can improve I/O efficiency by reducing the number of times data is read from or written to disk.\n* **Improved resource utilization:** By processing the data in batches, we can make better use of available resources, such as CPU and memory."
