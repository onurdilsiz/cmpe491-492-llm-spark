      "operation": "Reading data from CSV format: `csv_df = spark.read.format(\"csv\").option(\"header\", \"true\").load(\"path/to/data.csv\")`",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a CSV file. CSV is a row-based format that is not optimized for analytical queries. It lacks schema information, requires parsing on every read, and does not support predicate pushdown. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve performance, especially for large datasets. Parquet is generally preferred for its good balance of performance and compatibility.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nparquet_df = spark.read.parquet(\"path/to/data.parquet\")\nparquet_result = parquet_df.select(\"column1\").collect()\nprint(\"Parquet Result:\", parquet_result)\n\n# If you need to convert from CSV to Parquet:\n# csv_df = spark.read.format(\"csv\").option(\"header\", \"true\").load(\"path/to/data.csv\")\n# csv_df.write.parquet(\"path/to/data.parquet\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet offers several benefits:\n- **Faster Reads:** Parquet is a columnar format, allowing Spark to read only the necessary columns, reducing I/O.\n- **Compression:** Parquet supports efficient compression algorithms, reducing storage space and I/O.\n- **Schema Evolution:** Parquet stores schema information, enabling schema evolution and type safety.\n- **Predicate Pushdown:** Parquet allows Spark to push down filters to the data source, reducing the amount of data read.\n- **Optimized for Analytics:** Parquet is designed for analytical workloads, making it more efficient for Spark operations."
