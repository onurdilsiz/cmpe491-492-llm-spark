      "operation": "map() operation on json_rdd in line 44",
      "improvementExplanation": "The map() operation on json_rdd in line 44 can be replaced with mapPartitions() because the processing of each partition can be done independently. This would reduce function call overhead and improve I/O efficiency.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\njson_rdd = uri_rdd.mapPartitions(process_partition)\n```",
      "benefits": "Replacing map() with mapPartitions() in this case would provide the following benefits:\n\n* **Reduced function call overhead:** mapPartitions() avoids the overhead of calling the function for each element in the RDD, which can significantly improve performance.\n* **Optimized I/O:** mapPartitions() allows for more efficient I/O operations, as data can be processed in larger chunks.\n* **Improved resource utilization:** mapPartitions() can lead to better resource utilization, as it can take advantage of multiple cores or nodes in a cluster."
