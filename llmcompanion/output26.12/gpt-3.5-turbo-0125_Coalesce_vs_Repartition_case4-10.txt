            "operation": "df2.repartition(2)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(2) operation is used to increase the number of partitions to 2. However, in this case, as the number of partitions is being reduced, coalesce() can be more efficient than repartition().",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df2.coalesce(2)",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce(2) instead of repartition(2) will reduce shuffling, optimize resource usage, and potentially lead to faster job runtime."
