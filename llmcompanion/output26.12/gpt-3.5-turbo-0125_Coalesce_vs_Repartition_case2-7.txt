            "operation": "data = sc.textFile(dataset, 40)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(40) call is used to set the number of partitions to 40 when reading the text file 'dataset'. This operation results in a full shuffle of the data across 40 partitions, which might be unnecessary and inefficient for this scenario.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "data = sc.textFile(dataset).coalesce(40)",
            "benefits": "By replacing repartition(40) with coalesce(40), we can avoid a full shuffle of the data and simply reduce the number of partitions to 40 if needed. This can lead to improved resource usage, reduced shuffling overhead, and potentially faster job execution."
