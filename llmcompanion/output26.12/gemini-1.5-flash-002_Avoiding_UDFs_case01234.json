            "improvementExplanation": "The UDF `multiply_by_two` simply multiplies a column by 2. This can be directly achieved using the built-in `multiply` function or the `*` operator within Spark SQL.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "result_with_builtin = df.withColumn(\"doubled\", col(\"numbers\") * 2)\nresult_with_builtin.show()",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with a built-in function eliminates the overhead of UDF serialization and deserialization, allowing Spark's Catalyst optimizer to perform more efficient query planning and execution. This leads to improved performance and reduced resource consumption."
