            "operation": "repartition(100)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition(100)` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame. However, since the subsequent operations do not require a shuffle, using `coalesce(100)` instead would achieve the same result without incurring the overhead of a full shuffle. This would lead to reduced shuffling, improved resource usage, and faster job runtime.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df = df.coalesce(100)",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` would reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and lead to a faster job runtime."
