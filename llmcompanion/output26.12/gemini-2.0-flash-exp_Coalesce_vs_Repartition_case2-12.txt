      "operation": "sqldf = sqldf.repartition(partitions)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used in the `load_dataframe` method of the `CCIndexSparkJob` class to increase or decrease the number of partitions of the DataFrame `sqldf`. In this specific case, the number of partitions is set to `self.args.num_output_partitions`. Since the goal is to reduce the number of partitions to match the desired output partitions, `coalesce()` can be used instead of `repartition()`. `coalesce()` avoids a full shuffle, which is what `repartition()` does, and instead tries to combine existing partitions. This is more efficient when reducing the number of partitions.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "sqldf = sqldf.coalesce(partitions)",
      "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` reduces shuffling, which is a costly operation in Spark. By avoiding a full shuffle, `coalesce()` improves resource usage, reduces network traffic, and leads to faster job runtime. It is more efficient when reducing the number of partitions as it tries to combine existing partitions instead of creating new ones."
