            "improvementExplanation": "The `map()` operation in this case involves applying the `total_salary` function to each row in the DataFrame. This function takes two arguments, `salary` and `bonus`, and returns the sum of these values. Since the function operates on individual rows, it cannot be efficiently parallelized using `mapPartitions()`. However, if the `total_salary` function could be modified to accept a batch of salaries and bonuses and return a corresponding batch of results, then `mapPartitions()` could be used to improve performance by reducing function call overhead and optimizing I/O.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\n# Assuming the total_salary function can be modified to accept a batch of salaries and bonuses\ndef batch_total_salary(salaries, bonuses):\n  # Implement the logic to calculate the total salary for each batch of salaries and bonuses\n  return total_salaries\n\ndf = df.withColumn('new_salary', mapPartitions(lambda partition: batch_total_salary(partition['salary'], partition['bonus'])))```",
            "benefits": "Switching to `mapPartitions()` in this case could potentially lead to reduced function call overhead, optimized I/O, and improved resource utilization. However, this would require modifying the `total_salary` function to accept and process batches of data."
