      "operation": "Reading CSV file from HDFS (line 10)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current CSV format is not optimized for efficient reads and writes. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve performance due to columnar storage, compression, and predicate pushdown capabilities.",
