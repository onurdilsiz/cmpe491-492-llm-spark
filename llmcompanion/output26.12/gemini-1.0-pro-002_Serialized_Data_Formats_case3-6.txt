    {
      "operation": "Read CSV file into DataFrame (line 28)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Reading a CSV file directly into a DataFrame can be inefficient, especially for large datasets. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve read performance due to their optimized columnar storage and compression capabilities.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\ncustomerDF = spark.read.parquet(\"retailstore.parquet\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Using Parquet or ORC instead of CSV provides the following benefits:\n- **Faster read performance:** Columnar storage allows for efficient data access and filtering, reducing the amount of data that needs to be read.\n- **Compression:** Parquet and ORC compress data efficiently, reducing storage space and network transfer times.\n- **Query optimization:** Predicate pushdown allows filtering to be performed directly on the compressed data, further improving query performance."

    {
      "operation": "Write DataFrame to a temporary table (line 42)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Writing a DataFrame to a temporary table using the default format (likely Parquet) is already optimized. However, if the temporary table is used repeatedly, consider persisting it as a Parquet or ORC file for faster subsequent reads.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\ncustomerDF.write.parquet(\"customer_parquet\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Persisting the temporary table as Parquet or ORC provides the same benefits as mentioned above for reading Parquet files."
