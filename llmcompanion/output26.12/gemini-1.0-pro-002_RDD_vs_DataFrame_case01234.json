            "rddOperation": "map",
            "improvementExplanation": "RDDs are less efficient than DataFrames for data transformations due to their immutability and lack of query optimization capabilities. Using a DataFrame/Dataset can significantly improve performance by enabling optimized query plans and avoiding unnecessary data shuffling.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\n# Create a DataFrame from the RDD\ndf = spark.createDataFrame(rdd, schema=['id', 'name'])\n\n# Apply the transformation using a DataFrame API\ndf_result = df.withColumn('name', col('name').upper())\n\n# Collect the results\ndf_result.collect()\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to DataFrame/Dataset for this operation will:\n- Improve performance by leveraging optimized query plans.\n- Reduce data shuffling by processing data in a more efficient manner.\n- Enhance resource utilization by avoiding unnecessary data copies."

        {
            "rddOperation": "repartition",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition` method is used to increase the number of partitions in a DataFrame. However, it can be inefficient if the number of partitions is set too high, as it can lead to unnecessary data shuffling. Using `coalesce` instead can be more efficient, as it only reduces the number of partitions.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\n# Use coalesce instead of repartition\ncoalesced_df = df.coalesce(10)\n\n# Print the number of partitions\nprint('Number of partitions after coalesce:', coalesced_df.rdd.getNumPartitions())\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce` will:\n- Reduce data shuffling by only merging partitions when necessary.\n- Improve performance by avoiding unnecessary data movement.\n- Optimize resource utilization by using fewer partitions."

            "rddOperation": "map",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `map` operation processes each element of an RDD individually, which can be inefficient for complex transformations. Using `mapPartitions` can improve performance by processing elements in batches, reducing the number of function calls and data serialization.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\n# Use mapPartitions instead of map\nmapped_df = df.rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: [(x * 2) for x in partition])\n\n# Collect the results\nmapped_df.collect()\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to `mapPartitions` will:\n- Improve performance by processing elements in batches.\n- Reduce function calls and data serialization.\n- Optimize resource utilization by processing data more efficiently."

        {
            "rddOperation": "CSV",
            "improvementExplanation": "Reading data from CSV files using the `csv` format can be less efficient than using optimized formats like Parquet or ORC. These formats provide better compression, columnar storage, and optimized query execution.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\n# Read data from Parquet file\nparquet_df = spark.read.parquet('path/to/data.parquet')\n\n# Select the desired column\nparquet_result = parquet_df.select('column1').collect()\n\n# Print the result\nprint('Parquet Result:', parquet_result)\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC will:\n- Improve performance by using optimized data formats.\n- Reduce storage space requirements due to compression.\n- Enable faster query execution due to columnar storage."

            "rddOperation": "UDF",
            "improvementExplanation": "UDFs can be less efficient than built-in Spark SQL functions, as they require data serialization and deserialization. Using built-in functions can improve performance and reduce overhead.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\n# Use built-in multiply function\ndoubled_df = df.withColumn('doubled', col('numbers') * 2)\n\n# Show the result\ndoubled_df.show()\n```",
