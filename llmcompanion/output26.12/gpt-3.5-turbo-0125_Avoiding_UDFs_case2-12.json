            "improvementExplanation": "The UDF process_record is used to process each WARC record. This UDF can be replaced with native DataFrame operations to leverage Spark's built-in functions for better performance and optimization.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "Instead of using a UDF, the processing logic within the process_record method can be integrated directly into DataFrame transformations.",
            "benefits": "By avoiding UDFs and using native DataFrame operations, Spark can optimize query execution plans, reduce serialization overhead, and improve overall performance."
