      "operation": "results = lines.map(lambda x: check_prem_typ_desc(x[16]))",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `map` operation applies the `check_prem_typ_desc` function to each element of the RDD. Since `check_prem_typ_desc` operates on a single element at a time and doesn't require any state or context from other elements, it can be efficiently performed at the partition level using `mapPartitions`. This reduces the overhead of calling the function for each element individually, as `mapPartitions` applies the function to an iterator of elements within a partition.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "results = lines.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: (check_prem_typ_desc(x[16]) for x in iterator))",
      "benefits": "Switching to `mapPartitions` reduces function call overhead because the `check_prem_typ_desc` function is called once per partition instead of once per element. This can lead to significant performance improvements, especially for large datasets, as it reduces the number of function calls and allows for more efficient processing of data within each partition. It also allows for potential optimizations within the iterator processing if needed."
