    {
      "operation": "df2 = df1.withColumn('Weather_Station', df1['value'].substr(5, 6))",
      "improvementExplanation": "The transformation involves extracting a substring from each element in the 'value' column. This operation can be performed efficiently at the partition level using mapPartitions() instead of map(). By processing data in batches within each partition, mapPartitions() can reduce function call overhead and potentially improve I/O performance.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "df2 = df1.rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: (row.withColumn('Weather_Station', row['value'].substr(5, 6)) for row in partition))",
      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() in this case can potentially lead to reduced function call overhead, optimized I/O, and improved performance for partition-level operations."
