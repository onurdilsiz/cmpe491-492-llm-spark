      "improvementExplanation": "The UDF `splitPaths` can be replaced with the built-in function `split` from Spark SQL. This function takes a string and a delimiter as arguments and returns an array of strings. In this case, the delimiter is `/`.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "explodedPaths = csvDF.withColumn(\"Path\", explode(split(csvDF[\"Path\"], \"/\")))",
      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with a built-in function provides several benefits:\n- **Catalyst Optimizations:** Built-in functions are optimized by Catalyst, Spark's query optimizer, which can improve query performance.\n- **Performance Improvement:** Built-in functions are generally faster than UDFs, as they are written in Scala and compiled to native code.\n- **Reduced Serialization Overhead:** UDFs require serialization and deserialization, which can add overhead to data processing. Built-in functions avoid this overhead."
