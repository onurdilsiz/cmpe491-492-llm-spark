            "operation": "Reading input file list using `sc.textFile` in `run_job` method of `CCSparkJob` class.",
            "improvementExplanation": "The input file list is read as plain text. While this is suitable for a list of file paths, it doesn't directly involve data processing. However, if the file list itself becomes large, using a more efficient format like Parquet or ORC could improve read times. In this case, the benefit is minimal, but for consistency, we can consider using a more efficient format if the file list is large.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n    def run_job(self, sc, sqlc):\n        # Assuming the input file is now a Parquet file\n        input_data = sqlc.read.parquet(self.args.input)\n        # Assuming the input file has a single column named 'path'\n        output = input_data.rdd.map(lambda row: row.path).mapPartitionsWithIndex(self.process_warcs) \\\n            .reduceByKey(self.reduce_by_key_func)\n\n        sqlc.createDataFrame(output, schema=self.output_schema) \\\n            .coalesce(self.args.num_output_partitions) \\\n            .write \\\n            .format(self.args.output_format) \\\n            .option(\"compression\", self.args.output_compression) \\\n            .saveAsTable(self.args.output)\n\n        self.log_aggregators(sc)\n```",

            "improvementExplanation": "The code currently supports multiple output formats (parquet, orc, json, csv). While flexible, using Parquet or ORC is generally recommended for performance. Parquet and ORC are columnar formats, which are much more efficient for analytical workloads than row-based formats like CSV or JSON. They also support compression and predicate pushdown.",
