      "improvementExplanation": "Accessing the RDD directly using .rdd is generally unnecessary when working with DataFrames.  The DataFrame API provides methods to manage partitions more efficiently and avoids the overhead of converting to and from RDDs.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "repartitioned_df.rdd.getNumPartitions() can be replaced with repartitioned_df.rdd.getNumPartitions(). This is not ideal, but there is no direct equivalent in the DataFrame API to get the number of partitions without accessing the underlying RDD.  For most operations, this information is not needed and the DataFrame API should be used exclusively.",
      "benefits": "Avoids unnecessary conversion to RDD, reducing overhead.  Using DataFrame's built-in partition management is generally more efficient."
    },
    {
      "rddOperation": "The usage of repartition (line 20) which internally uses RDD operations.",
      "improvementExplanation": "The repartition operation shuffles all data across the cluster, which is very expensive.  If the number of partitions is not carefully chosen, it can lead to significant performance degradation.  In this case, repartitioning to 10 partitions is likely unnecessary and inefficient.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "sales_df.repartition(10) can be removed or replaced with a more appropriate partitioning strategy. If no specific partitioning is needed, the default partitioning of the DataFrame should be used. If a specific number of partitions is required, consider using coalesce() instead of repartition() if the number of partitions is reduced.  If the goal is to improve performance of a specific operation, consider using other optimization techniques like broadcasting small datasets or using appropriate data structures.",
      "benefits": "Avoids unnecessary data shuffling, reducing execution time and resource consumption. Using the default partitioning or coalesce() when reducing partitions avoids unnecessary data movement."
