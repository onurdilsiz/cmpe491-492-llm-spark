            "operation": "mapPartitions(is_number) on line 27",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `is_number` function iterates over each element in the partition to perform calculations. This operation is well-suited for `mapPartitions` because it can be applied to each partition independently, reducing the number of function calls and improving I/O efficiency.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\n# Replace map with mapPartitions\nmap_q3 = flat_q3.mapPartitions(is_number)\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to `mapPartitions` offers several benefits:\n- **Reduced function call overhead:** By applying the function to each partition instead of each element, we significantly reduce the number of function calls, leading to improved performance.\n- **Optimized I/O:** `mapPartitions` processes data within each partition, minimizing data shuffling between partitions and optimizing I/O operations.\n- **Improved resource utilization:** By processing data in parallel across partitions, `mapPartitions` utilizes cluster resources more efficiently, leading to faster execution times."
