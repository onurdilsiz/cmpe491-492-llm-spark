            "improvementExplanation": "The `pointToCell` UDF calculates the cell index for each point. This can be replaced with a native Spark transformation using `withColumn` and built-in functions like `floor`.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "inputPoints.withColumn(\"cell_x\", floor(col(\"_1\") / omega)).withColumn(\"cell_y\", floor(col(\"_2\") / omega)).withColumn(\"cell\", struct(col(\"cell_x\"), col(\"cell_y\"))).groupBy(\"cell\").count()",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with built-in functions allows Spark's optimizer to leverage Catalyst optimizations, leading to improved performance and reduced serialization overhead.  The native approach avoids the overhead of Python UDF execution."

            "operation": "region_counts7 function (lines 42-53)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `region_counts7` UDF calculates the total count within a 7x7 region. This can be optimized using Spark's window functions or by joining the `cells_counts` DataFrame with itself multiple times.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "A more efficient approach would involve creating a grid of cells and then using joins or window functions to count points within the 7x7 region.  This avoids the Python loop and leverages Spark's distributed processing capabilities.  The exact implementation would depend on the data structure used to represent cells and their counts.",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with a Spark SQL approach enables parallel processing and avoids the overhead of Python UDF execution, leading to significant performance improvements. Catalyst optimizations can further enhance efficiency."
