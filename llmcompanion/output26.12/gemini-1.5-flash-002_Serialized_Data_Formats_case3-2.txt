      "operation": "Reading CSV data from 'file:///root/data_team_2.csv' at line 60: `path = sc.textFile(\"file:///root/data_team_2.csv\")` and line 62: `df = spark.read.csv(path)`",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a CSV file, which is a text-based format.  CSV is inefficient for large datasets because it lacks built-in compression and schema enforcement.  Parquet or ORC offer significant performance improvements by providing columnar storage, compression, and schema metadata.  This enables faster query processing, especially when dealing with large datasets and complex filtering operations as seen in the provided code.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\npath = \"file:///root/data_team_2.parquet\"\ndf = spark.read.parquet(path)\n```\n\nOr using ORC:\n\n```python\npath = \"file:///root/data_team_2.orc\"\ndf = spark.read.orc(path)\n```\n\nNote: This requires converting the original CSV to Parquet or ORC beforehand using `df.write.parquet(output_path)` or `df.write.orc(output_path)` respectively.",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC provides faster read and write speeds due to efficient columnar storage and compression.  It also enables predicate pushdown, allowing Spark to filter data at the storage level, further improving query performance. Schema enforcement ensures data integrity and simplifies data processing."

    {
      "operation": "Writing data to CSV at line 72: `filtered_df.write.mode('default').option(\"header\", \"false\").csv(output_path)`",
      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the input operation, writing to CSV is inefficient for large datasets.  Parquet or ORC offer significant performance improvements by providing compression and efficient storage.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\noutput_path = \"file:///root/filtered_data_team_2_clean\"\nfiltered_df.write.mode('overwrite').parquet(output_path)\n```\n\nOr using ORC:\n\n```python\noutput_path = \"file:///root/filtered_data_team_2_clean\"\nfiltered_df.write.mode('overwrite').orc(output_path)\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC results in smaller file sizes due to compression, leading to faster writes and reduced storage costs.  It also improves subsequent read performance as described above."
