            "improvementExplanation": "This map operation splits each line of the employee data.  This is an I/O-bound operation where the overhead of repeatedly calling the lambda function for each line is significant. mapPartitions can process multiple lines within a partition at once, reducing the function call overhead and improving efficiency.",

            "improvementExplanation": "This map operation extracts the department and salary from each employee record.  Similar to the previous case, the repeated function calls for each record introduce overhead. mapPartitions can process multiple records within a partition, reducing the overhead and potentially improving performance, especially for large datasets.",
