      "improvementExplanation": "The `map` operation is used to parse each line of the text file into a list of values. This can be done more efficiently using the `DataFrameReader` API, which can directly infer the schema and create a DataFrame from the text file.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\n# Read the text file directly into a DataFrame\nfiltered_transactions_df = spark.read.text(\"path/to/transactions.txt\").selectExpr(\"split(value, ',')[0] as transaction_id\", \"split(value, ',')[1] as customer_id\", \"split(value, ',')[2] as amount\", \"split(value, ',')[3] as category\")\n```",
