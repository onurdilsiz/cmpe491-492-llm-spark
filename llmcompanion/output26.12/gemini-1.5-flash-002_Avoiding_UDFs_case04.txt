      "improvementExplanation": "The 'create_greeting' UDF is used to create a greeting message. This can be easily replaced with the built-in `concat` function in Spark SQL, which offers better performance and optimization opportunities within the Spark engine.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "customer_with_greeting_df = customer_df.withColumn(\"greeting\", concat(lit(\"Hello, \"), col(\"name\"), lit(\"!\")))",
      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with a built-in function enables Catalyst optimizations, leading to improved performance and reduced serialization overhead.  Catalyst can push down the `concat` operation into the execution plan, resulting in more efficient processing compared to the UDF which requires separate serialization and deserialization steps."
