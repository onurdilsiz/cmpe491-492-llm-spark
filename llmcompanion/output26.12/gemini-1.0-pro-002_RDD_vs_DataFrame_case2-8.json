            "improvementExplanation": "mapPartitions is a low-level RDD operation that can be inefficient for complex transformations. DataFrames/Datasets offer higher-level abstractions and optimized execution plans.",
            "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\n# Assuming 'data_iterator' is an RDD of tuples (features, labels)\nfeatures_df = data_iterator.map(lambda x: x[0]).toDF()\nlabels_df = data_iterator.map(lambda x: x[1]).toDF()\n# Perform transformations and training using DataFrames\nmodel.fit(features_df, labels_df, ...)\n```",
            "benefits": "Using DataFrames/Datasets instead of mapPartitions can lead to:\n- **Improved performance:** DataFrames/Datasets leverage Spark SQL's Catalyst Optimizer for query optimization, resulting in efficient execution plans.\n- **Reduced shuffling:** DataFrames/Datasets minimize data shuffling between partitions, improving performance and scalability.\n- **Better resource usage:** DataFrames/Datasets efficiently manage memory and CPU resources, reducing overall resource consumption."

            "benefits": "Using DataFrames/Datasets instead of collect can lead to:\n- **Reduced data movement:** DataFrames/Datasets process data in a distributed manner, avoiding unnecessary data transfers.\n- **Improved scalability:** DataFrames/Datasets can handle large datasets efficiently without overloading the driver.\n- **Faster execution:** Lazy evaluation and distributed processing enable faster execution times."
