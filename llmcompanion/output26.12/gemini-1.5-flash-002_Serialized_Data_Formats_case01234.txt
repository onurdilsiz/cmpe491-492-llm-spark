      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a CSV file, which is a text-based format.  CSV files are not optimized for storage or query performance in Spark.  Switching to a columnar storage format like Parquet or ORC significantly improves performance by enabling efficient data compression, predicate pushdown, and vectorized processing. Parquet and ORC files store data in a columnar format, allowing Spark to read only the necessary columns for a query, reducing I/O operations and improving query speed. They also support efficient compression, reducing storage space and improving read performance.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "parquet_df = spark.read.format(\"parquet\").load(\"path/to/data.parquet\")\nparquet_result = parquet_df.select(\"column1\").collect()\nprint(\"Parquet Result:\", parquet_result)",
      "benefits": "Faster read/write operations, better compression, reduced storage space, improved query performance due to predicate pushdown and vectorized processing."
