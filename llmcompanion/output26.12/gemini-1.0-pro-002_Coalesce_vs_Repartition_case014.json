            "operation": "repartitioned_df = transactions_df.repartition(10)  # Unnecessary repartition",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame to 10. However, this is unnecessary in this case because the DataFrame already has a sufficient number of partitions. Using `coalesce()` instead would reduce the number of partitions, which can improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be shuffled.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "coalesced_df = transactions_df.coalesce(10)",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` would reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and potentially lead to a faster runtime."
