            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the RDD after the flatMap transformation. However, in this context, the operation does not require a full shuffle as it only needs to adjust the number of partitions without redistributing the data.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "data_rdd = hbase_rdd.flatMap(lambda x: get_valid_items(x)).coalesce(numPartitions)",
            "benefits": "By replacing repartition() with coalesce(), the code will avoid unnecessary shuffling of data, leading to improved resource usage, reduced overhead, and faster job runtime."
