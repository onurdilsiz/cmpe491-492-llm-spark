      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase or decrease the number of partitions of the RDD. In this case, it's used to set the number of partitions to `L` after reading the data from the text file. Since the goal is to reduce the number of partitions, `coalesce()` can be used instead of `repartition()`. `coalesce()` avoids a full shuffle when reducing the number of partitions, which is more efficient than `repartition()` which always performs a full shuffle. If L is less than the initial number of partitions, coalesce can be used. If L is greater than the initial number of partitions, repartition is needed.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "rawData = sc.textFile(data_path)\nnum_partitions = rawData.getNumPartitions()\nif L < num_partitions:\n    rawData = rawData.coalesce(numPartitions=L)\nelse:\n    rawData = rawData.repartition(numPartitions=L)",
      "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` when reducing the number of partitions will reduce shuffling, which will improve resource usage and potentially lead to faster job runtime. `coalesce()` attempts to combine existing partitions to achieve the desired number of partitions, avoiding a full shuffle. If L is greater than the initial number of partitions, repartition is needed, and no improvement can be made."
