      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads a XML file.  XML is not a columnar storage format and lacks efficient compression.  Switching to Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance and reduce storage space.  Parquet and ORC support efficient columnar storage, compression, and predicate pushdown, leading to faster query execution.",

      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads a text file containing stop words. While a text file is simple, it lacks the efficiency of columnar formats like Parquet or ORC for larger datasets.  Switching to Parquet (though less ideal for a small stop word list) would allow for better integration with Spark's optimized data processing pipeline.",
