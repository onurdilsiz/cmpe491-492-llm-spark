    {
      "operation": "Line 68: `weightsRDD = spark_context.parallelize(weights)`",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `parallelize` operation creates an RDD with the number of partitions equal to the number of cores in your Spark cluster.  Since `weights` is a small NumPy array, there's no need for a large number of partitions.  Repartitioning later is unnecessary and causes a full shuffle. Using `coalesce` avoids this unnecessary shuffle.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "weightsRDD = spark_context.parallelize(weights).coalesce(1)",
      "benefits": "Reduced shuffling, improved resource usage, faster runtime."
    },
    {
      "operation": "Line 69: `dataRDD = spark_context.parallelize(data)`",
      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to `weightsRDD`, `dataRDD` is created from a relatively small NumPy array. Repartitioning later is inefficient. `coalesce` to a smaller number of partitions (or even 1) will avoid unnecessary shuffling.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "dataRDD = spark_context.parallelize(data).coalesce(1)",
      "benefits": "Reduced shuffling, improved resource usage, faster runtime."
    },
    {
      "operation": "Line 84: `pos_hidden_states = as_block_matrix(spark_context.parallelize(pos_hidden_states))`",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `pos_hidden_states` array is created after operations within the driver. Parallelizing and then immediately converting to a `BlockMatrix` leads to unnecessary overhead.  `coalesce` can reduce the number of partitions before creating the `BlockMatrix`.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "pos_hidden_states = as_block_matrix(spark_context.parallelize(pos_hidden_states).coalesce(1))",

      "operation": "Line 85: `pos_hidden_probs = as_block_matrix(spark_context.parallelize(pos_hidden_probs))`",
      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the previous case, `pos_hidden_probs` is created in the driver. Parallelizing and converting to a `BlockMatrix` is inefficient. `coalesce` can optimize this.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "pos_hidden_probs = as_block_matrix(spark_context.parallelize(pos_hidden_probs).coalesce(1))",

      "improvementExplanation": "Again, `neg_visible_probs` is generated in the driver.  The parallelization and subsequent `BlockMatrix` conversion are inefficient. Using `coalesce` avoids unnecessary shuffling.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "neg_visible_probs = as_block_matrix(spark_context.parallelize(neg_visible_probs).coalesce(1))",

    {
      "operation": "Line 113: `weightsBlockMatrix = as_block_matrix(spark_context.parallelize(weights))`",
      "improvementExplanation": "This repartition occurs within the loop.  Since the weights are updated iteratively in the driver, repartitioning in each iteration is highly inefficient.  Using `coalesce` to a single partition would be significantly more efficient.",
