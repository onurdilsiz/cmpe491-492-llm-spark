**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of User-Defined Functions (UDFs). All data transformations and operations are performed using Spark's built-in functions and native DataFrame/Dataset operations.

**Benefits of Avoiding UDFs:**

* **Catalyst Optimizations:** Spark's Catalyst optimizer can effectively optimize built-in functions and native DataFrame/Dataset operations, resulting in improved query performance.
* **Performance:** Built-in functions and native operations are generally more efficient than UDFs, as they are optimized for Spark's execution engine.
* **Serialization Overhead:** UDFs require serialization and deserialization, which can introduce overhead and slow down performance. Avoiding UDFs reduces this overhead.

**Conclusion:**

The provided Spark code effectively leverages Spark's built-in functions and native DataFrame/Dataset operations, resulting in optimized and efficient data processing.
