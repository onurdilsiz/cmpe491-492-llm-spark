Since the pointToCell function processes elements independently, it can be more efficient to use mapPartitions() to process multiple elements in a partition at once, reducing function call overhead.",

            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() can improve performance by reducing the overhead of calling the pointToCell function for each element individually and allowing batch processing at the partition level."

            "improvementExplanation": "The map() operation is used to apply the SequentialFFT function to each element in the input RDD. Since SequentialFFT operates on a list of points within a partition, it can be more efficient to use mapPartitions() to process multiple elements in a partition at once, especially for I/O-heavy operations like distance calculations.",
