      "operation": "repartitioned_df = filtered_transactions_df.repartition(10)  # Inefficient partitioning",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame. However, in this case, the DataFrame is already filtered and only contains transactions related to the 'Electronics' category. Therefore, reducing the number of partitions using `coalesce()` would be more efficient as it avoids a full shuffle and only redistributes data across existing partitions.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "coalesced_df = filtered_transactions_df.coalesce(10)",
      "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` in this case would provide the following benefits:\n- Reduced shuffling: Since the data is already filtered, there is no need to shuffle it across all partitions.\n- Improved resource usage: By reducing the number of partitions, we can utilize resources more efficiently.\n- Faster job runtime: Avoiding a full shuffle can significantly improve the job runtime."
