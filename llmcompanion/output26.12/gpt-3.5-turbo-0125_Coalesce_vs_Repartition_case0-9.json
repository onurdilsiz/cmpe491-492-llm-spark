            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(4) operation is used to increase the number of partitions to 4 after the reduceByKey operation. However, since repartition() involves a full shuffle, it may be inefficient in this case as we are only increasing the partitions. Using coalesce(4) instead of repartition(4) can efficiently reduce the number of partitions without triggering a full shuffle.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "rdd4 = rdd3.reduceByKey(lambda a,b: a+b).coalesce(4)",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce(4) from repartition(4) will reduce unnecessary shuffling, optimize resource usage, and potentially lead to faster job execution."
