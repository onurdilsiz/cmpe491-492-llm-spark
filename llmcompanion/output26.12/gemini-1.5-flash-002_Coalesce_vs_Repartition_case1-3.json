            "improvementExplanation": "The provided code uses `repartition(200)` before writing the data to CSV.  Since the purpose is to write the data, the number of partitions only affects the write operation's parallelism.  If the number of partitions in `df2` is less than 200, `repartition` will perform a full shuffle to increase the number of partitions. However, if the goal is simply to write the data to HDFS with a specific number of output files (potentially for better parallelism during the write operation), and the current number of partitions is already greater than or equal to 200, using `repartition` is unnecessary and inefficient.  `coalesce` can achieve the same outcome without the full shuffle if the current number of partitions is greater than or equal to 200. If the current number of partitions is less than 200, `coalesce` will still be more efficient than `repartition` because it avoids unnecessary shuffling.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "num_partitions = 200\ncurrent_num_partitions = df2.rdd.getNumPartitions()\nif current_num_partitions < num_partitions:\n    df2.repartition(num_partitions).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/repartition/200\")\nelse:\n    df2.coalesce(num_partitions).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/repartition/200\")",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce` can significantly reduce the shuffle time and resource consumption, leading to faster job completion. If the number of partitions in `df2` is already greater than or equal to 200, using `coalesce` avoids a completely unnecessary shuffle operation.  Even if the number of partitions is less than 200, `coalesce` will still be more efficient as it only performs a partial shuffle if needed."
