```json
{
  "detected": false,
  "occurrences": 0,
  "response": []
}
```

**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of User-Defined Functions (UDFs). The code primarily focuses on basic data manipulation using RDDs and flatMap transformation. 

Therefore, there are no UDFs to analyze or replace with Spark's built-in functions or native DataFrame/Dataset operations. 

The response is structured as a JSON object with the following fields:

* **detected**: A boolean indicating whether UDF usage was detected in the provided code.
* **occurrences**: The number of times UDFs are used in the code.
* **response**: An array of objects, where each object provides details about the detected UDFs. Since no UDFs were found, this array is empty.
