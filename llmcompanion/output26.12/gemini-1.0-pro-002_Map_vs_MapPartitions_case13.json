            "improvementExplanation": "The filtering operation in `electronics_df = repartitioned_df.filter(repartitioned_df[\"category\"] == \"Electronics\")` can be optimized by using `mapPartitions()` instead of `map()`. This is because the filtering logic can be applied at the partition level, reducing the number of function calls and improving I/O efficiency.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\nelectronics_df = repartitioned_df.rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: filter(lambda row: row[\"category\"] == \"Electronics\", partition))\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to `mapPartitions()` offers several benefits:\n- **Reduced function call overhead:** By applying the filtering logic within each partition, we avoid unnecessary function calls for rows that don't meet the filtering criteria.\n- **Optimized I/O:** `mapPartitions()` processes data within each partition, minimizing data shuffling and improving I/O efficiency.\n- **Improved resource utilization:** By reducing the number of function calls and optimizing I/O, `mapPartitions()` can lead to better resource utilization and faster processing times."
