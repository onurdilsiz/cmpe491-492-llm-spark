            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used to increase the number of partitions when reading a Parquet file into a DataFrame. However, in this context, the operation does not require a full shuffle as it only affects the initial partitioning of the DataFrame.",

            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() instead of repartition() will reduce unnecessary shuffling, leading to improved resource usage and potentially faster job runtime."
