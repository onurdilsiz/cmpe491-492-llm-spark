      "improvementExplanation": "The code currently reads data from a CSV file. CSV is a row-based format and is not optimized for analytical queries. Reading CSV files can be slow, especially for large datasets, as it requires parsing the text-based data. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance due to schema projection and predicate pushdown.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "parquetDF = spark.read.parquet(hdfs_path_to_parquet)\nparquetDF = parquetDF.select(\"Path\", \"BlocksCount\", \"FileSize\").filter(\"BlocksCount != 0\")",
      "benefits": "Parquet is a columnar format, which allows Spark to read only the necessary columns, reducing I/O. It also supports predicate pushdown, enabling Spark to filter data at the storage layer, further improving performance. Parquet also provides compression, reducing storage space and I/O."
