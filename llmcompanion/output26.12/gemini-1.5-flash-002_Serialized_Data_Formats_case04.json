            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads customer data from a text file (\"path/to/customers.txt\") using the textFile method of SparkContext.  Text files are not optimized for Spark processing. They lack schema information, leading to inefficient parsing and data processing.  Switching to a columnar storage format like Parquet or ORC provides significant performance improvements. These formats offer schema enforcement, compression, and support for predicate pushdown, resulting in faster query execution and reduced storage costs.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"CustomerDataProcessing\").master(\"local[*]\").getOrCreate()\n\n# Read data from Parquet file\ncustomer_df = spark.read.parquet(\"path/to/customers.parquet\")\n\n# ... rest of the code (filtering, UDF application, etc.)\n\nspark.stop()",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC offers several benefits:\n\n* **Faster Reads/Writes:** Columnar storage allows Spark to read only the necessary columns, significantly reducing I/O operations.\n* **Compression:** Parquet and ORC support efficient compression, reducing storage space and improving read performance.\n* **Schema Enforcement:**  These formats enforce schema, eliminating the need for data parsing and improving data integrity.\n* **Predicate Pushdown:**  Spark can push down filters to the storage layer, reducing the amount of data processed."
