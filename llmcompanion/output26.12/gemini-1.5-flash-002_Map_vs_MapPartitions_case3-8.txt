      "operation": "line 20: `rdd.zipWithIndex().map(lambda xi: IndexedRow(xi[1], xi[0]))`",
      "improvementExplanation": "The map transformation in the `as_block_matrix` function is applied to an RDD of vectors. Each vector is paired with its index using `zipWithIndex()`, and then the `map()` transformation converts each (index, vector) pair into an `IndexedRow` object. This operation can be performed more efficiently at the partition level using `mapPartitions()`.  Instead of calling the lambda function for each individual element, `mapPartitions()` processes all elements within a partition in a single batch, reducing the overhead of function calls and potentially improving I/O efficiency if the creation of `IndexedRow` objects involves significant computation or data transfer.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\ndef as_block_matrix(rdd, rowsPerBlock=65000, colsPerBlock=65000):\n    def convert_partition(iterator):\n        for index, vector in enumerate(iterator):\n            yield IndexedRow(index, vector)\n    return IndexedRowMatrix(\n        rdd.zipWithIndex().mapPartitions(convert_partition)\n    ).toBlockMatrix(rowsPerBlock, colsPerBlock)\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to `mapPartitions()` offers several benefits:\n\n* **Reduced function call overhead:** The lambda function is called once per partition instead of once per element.\n* **Improved I/O efficiency:** Data transfer and processing are batched at the partition level, potentially reducing I/O operations.\n* **Optimized resource utilization:**  Reduces the overhead on the Spark driver and improves overall performance, especially for large datasets."
