            "operation": "A.mapPartitions(lambda part: [list(part)]).toLocalIterator()",
            "improvementExplanation": "This operation iterates over each partition of the `A` RDD and converts each partition into a list. This is likely done to perform some operation on each partition locally, such as calculating the outer product of each row with itself. However, this operation requires a full shuffle, as each partition needs to be collected to the driver node. This can be inefficient, especially for large datasets.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "A.coalesce(1).mapPartitions(lambda part: [list(part)]).toLocalIterator()",
            "benefits": "By using `coalesce(1)`, we can reduce the number of partitions to 1, which will eliminate the need for a full shuffle. This will significantly improve the performance of the job, as the data will not need to be transferred over the network. Additionally, using `coalesce()` instead of `repartition()` will reduce the amount of memory used by the job, as there will be fewer partitions to store in memory."
