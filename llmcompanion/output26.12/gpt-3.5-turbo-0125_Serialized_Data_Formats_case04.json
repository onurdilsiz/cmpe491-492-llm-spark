            "improvementExplanation": "The current data format being used is text file format (CSV-like). Switching to a more optimized serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve performance by enabling better compression, predicate pushdown, and schema evolution capabilities.",

            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet format offers faster reads/writes, efficient compression, and enhanced query optimization through predicate pushdown."
