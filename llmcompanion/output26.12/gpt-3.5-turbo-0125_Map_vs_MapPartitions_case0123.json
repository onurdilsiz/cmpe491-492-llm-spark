            "improvementExplanation": "The current usage of map() applies the lambda function to each individual element, incurring function call overhead for each record. By using mapPartitions(), the transformation can be performed at the partition level, reducing the number of function calls and improving efficiency, especially for I/O-heavy operations.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "timestamps_rdd = error_logs_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: map(lambda log: log[0], partition))",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() reduces function call overhead by processing elements in batches at the partition level, leading to optimized I/O operations and improved performance for partition-level transformations."
