            "operation": "The map() operation is used on line 24 to calculate the average block size for each path.",
            "improvementExplanation": "The calculation of average block size involves summing the file sizes and block counts for each path. This operation can be performed more efficiently using mapPartitions() because it allows us to process data in batches at the partition level, reducing the number of function calls and improving I/O efficiency.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\nsmallBlocksListDF = spark.sql(\"SELECT Path, sum(FileSize)/sum(BlocksCount)/1048576 as avgblocksize, sum(FileSize)/1048576 as TotalSize, sum(BlocksCount) as totalblocks, \" + \" cast(current_date as string) as extract_dt \" + \" from explodedpaths GROUP BY path\").repartition(1).rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: map(lambda row: (row.Path, row.FileSize/row.BlocksCount/1048576, row.FileSize/1048576, row.BlocksCount, str(datetime.date.today())), partition))```",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() in this case offers several benefits:\n- **Reduced function call overhead:** By processing data in batches, we reduce the number of times the average block size calculation function is called, improving performance.\n- **Optimized I/O:** Reading and processing data in batches can improve I/O efficiency, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n- **Improved resource utilization:** By processing data in parallel across partitions, we can utilize cluster resources more efficiently."
