      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads a CSV file, which is a text-based format.  CSV files are not optimized for storage or query performance in Spark.  Parquet and ORC are columnar storage formats that offer significant performance advantages.  They provide better compression, faster read/write speeds, and enable predicate pushdown for improved query performance.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "df_pyspark = spark.read.parquet(\"test2.parquet\")\n# or\ndf_pyspark = spark.read.orc(\"test2.orc\")",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC offers several benefits:\n- **Faster read/write speeds:** Columnar storage allows Spark to read only the necessary columns, reducing I/O operations.\n- **Improved compression:** Parquet and ORC offer better compression ratios than CSV, reducing storage space and improving read times.\n- **Predicate pushdown:**  Spark can push down filters to the storage layer, further improving query performance by reducing the amount of data processed.\n- **Schema enforcement:** Parquet and ORC enforce schema, leading to better data integrity and reduced data processing overhead."
