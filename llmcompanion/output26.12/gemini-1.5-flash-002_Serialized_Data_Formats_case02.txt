      "operation": "Reading employee data from a text file using spark.sparkContext.textFile(\"path/to/employees.txt\") on line 8.",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads employee data from a text file (\"path/to/employees.txt\") using the textFile method, which is inefficient for large datasets.  Switching to a columnar storage format like Parquet or ORC significantly improves performance by enabling efficient data compression, predicate pushdown, and vectorized processing.  Parquet and ORC are optimized for analytical queries, offering faster read speeds and better compression compared to text files.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"OptimizedExample\").master(\"local[*]\").getOrCreate()\n\nemployee_df = spark.read.parquet(\"path/to/employees.parquet\")\n\nhigh_salary_df = employee_df.filter(employee_df[\"salary\"] > 50000)\nhigh_salary_count = high_salary_df.count()\nprint(f\"Number of employees with high salary: {high_salary_count}\")\n\nbonus_df = high_salary_df.withColumn(\"bonus\", high_salary_df[\"salary\"] * 1.1)\nprint(\"Sample employees with bonuses:\", bonus_df.select(\"employee_id\", \"name\", \"bonus\").show(5))\n\nspark.stop()",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC offers several benefits:\n\n* **Faster read/write speeds:** Columnar storage allows for reading only the necessary columns, reducing I/O operations.\n* **Improved compression:** Parquet and ORC offer better compression ratios than text files, reducing storage space and improving read performance.\n* **Predicate pushdown:** The query engine can push down filters to the storage layer, reducing the amount of data processed.\n* **Vectorized processing:** Parquet and ORC support vectorized processing, which significantly improves query performance."
