            "operation": "repartitioned_df = sales_df.repartition(10)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(10) operation unnecessarily creates 10 partitions, causing a full shuffle which can be inefficient for this small dataset. Since the goal is to reduce the number of partitions without a full shuffle, coalesce() can be used instead.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "coalesced_df = sales_df.coalesce(1)",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce(1) will reduce shuffling overhead, improve resource usage by minimizing data movement, and potentially lead to faster job execution due to fewer partitions to manage."
