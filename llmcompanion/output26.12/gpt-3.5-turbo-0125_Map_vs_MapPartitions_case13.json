            "operation": "filter(repartitioned_df[\"category\"] == \"Electronics\")",
            "improvementExplanation": "The filter operation is applied at the row level using map(), which can be inefficient for partition-level operations. By using mapPartitions(), we can process the data in batches at the partition level, reducing function call overhead and improving performance.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "electronics_df = repartitioned_df.rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: filter(lambda row: row[3] == 'Electronics', partition)).toDF(columns)",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() allows for processing data at the partition level, reducing function call overhead and potentially improving performance for partition-level operations."
