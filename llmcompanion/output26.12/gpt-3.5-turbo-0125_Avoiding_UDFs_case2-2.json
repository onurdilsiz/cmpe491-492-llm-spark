            "improvementExplanation": "The UDF 'getMSDiff' is used to calculate time difference in milliseconds. This can be replaced with native Python datetime functions to achieve the same functionality without the need for a UDF.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "ms = diff.total_seconds() * 1000.0",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with native Python functions eliminates the overhead of UDF serialization and enables better optimization by the Spark Catalyst engine."
