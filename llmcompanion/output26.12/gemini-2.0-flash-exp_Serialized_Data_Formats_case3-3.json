            "operation": "Reading data from CSV file: `df_pyspark = spark.read.csv(\"test2.csv\", header=True, inferSchema=True)`",
            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a CSV file. CSV is a row-based text format, which is not efficient for analytical workloads. It lacks schema information, requiring Spark to infer it, and it doesn't support compression or predicate pushdown. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve performance. Parquet is generally preferred for its better compression and encoding schemes, leading to faster reads and reduced storage space.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\ndf_pyspark = spark.read.parquet(\"test2.parquet\")\n# Assuming you have already converted the CSV to Parquet and saved it as test2.parquet\n# If not, you can convert and save it like this:\n# df_pyspark = spark.read.csv(\"test2.csv\", header=True, inferSchema=True)\n# df_pyspark.write.parquet(\"test2.parquet\")\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet offers several benefits: faster read times due to columnar storage, which allows Spark to read only the necessary columns; better compression, reducing storage space and I/O; and predicate pushdown, which allows Spark to filter data at the storage layer, reducing the amount of data that needs to be read and processed. This leads to significant performance improvements, especially for large datasets."
