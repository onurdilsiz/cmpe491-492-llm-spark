    {
      "operation": "Line 16: parsed_ratings = raw_ratings.map(lambda line: line.split(','))",
      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation splits each line of the input file.  This is an I/O-bound operation, and performing it within each partition using mapPartitions would reduce the overhead of repeatedly calling the split function for each line individually.  The function can process multiple lines at once within a partition.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "parsed_ratings = raw_ratings.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: [line.split(',') for line in iterator])",
      "benefits": "Reduced function call overhead by processing multiple lines within a partition. Improved efficiency by minimizing data transfer between the driver and executors."
    },
    {
      "operation": "Line 21: movie_counts = high_ratings.map(lambda x: (x[1], 1))",
      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation transforms each rating into a key-value pair. While not inherently I/O-bound, processing multiple records within a partition using mapPartitions can still reduce the overhead of repeatedly calling the lambda function.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "movie_counts = high_ratings.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: [(x[1], 1) for x in iterator])",
      "benefits": "Reduced function call overhead. Slightly improved performance due to batch processing within partitions."
    },
    {
      "operation": "Line 27: movie_count_key = movie_rating_counts.map(lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))",
      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation swaps the key and value. Similar to the previous case, processing within partitions reduces function call overhead.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "movie_count_key = movie_rating_counts.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: [(x[1], x[0]) for x in iterator])",
      "benefits": "Reduced function call overhead. Slightly improved performance due to batch processing within partitions."

    {
      "operation": "Line 36: movie_ratings = parsed_ratings.map(lambda x: (x[1], (float(x[2]), 1)))",
      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation transforms each rating into a key-value pair for aggregation.  Processing within partitions reduces function call overhead and improves efficiency.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "movie_ratings = parsed_ratings.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: [(x[1], (float(x[2]), 1)) for x in iterator])",
      "benefits": "Reduced function call overhead. Slightly improved performance due to batch processing within partitions."
    },

      "operation": "Line 46: movie_average_ratings = movie_rating_totals.map(lambda x: (x[0], x[1][0] / x[1][1]))",
      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation calculates the average rating.  Performing this calculation within partitions reduces the overhead of repeatedly calling the lambda function for each record.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "movie_average_ratings = movie_rating_totals.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: [(x[0], x[1][0] / x[1][1]) for x in iterator])",

    {
      "operation": "Line 56: final_movies = popular_movies.map(lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))",
      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation is a simple identity transformation. While the benefit might be minimal in this specific case, using mapPartitions maintains consistency and could offer slight performance gains in scenarios with larger datasets or more complex transformations.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "final_movies = popular_movies.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: [(x[0], x[1]) for x in iterator])",
      "benefits": "Maintains consistency with other map operations. Potentially slight performance improvement for larger datasets."
