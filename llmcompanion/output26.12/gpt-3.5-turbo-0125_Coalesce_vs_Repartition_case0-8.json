            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(2) operation is used to redistribute data across a specified number of partitions. In this case, the repartition() is used after the reduceByKey operation, which results in a full shuffle of data across 2 partitions. However, since the data size is small and the shuffle is unnecessary, coalesce() can be used for more efficient partition reduction without shuffling.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "rdd2 = rdd.reduceByKey(lambda a,b: a+b).coalesce(2)",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce(2) instead of repartition(2) will reduce unnecessary shuffling, optimize resource usage, and potentially lead to faster job execution."
