            "operation": "The UDF `check_prem_typ_desc` is used on line 7 and applied in the `map` transformation on line 14.",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `check_prem_typ_desc` UDF checks the length of the input string and returns a fixed string based on the condition. This logic can be easily implemented using `when` and `otherwise` functions from pyspark.sql.functions, which are optimized for Spark's execution engine and can leverage Catalyst optimizations.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import when, lit\n\n# ... other code ...\n\nresults = lines.map(lambda x: when(len(x[16]) == 0, lit('NULL\\tNULL\\tNULL')).otherwise(lit('TEXT\\tPREMISES\\tVALID')))\n\n# ... other code ...\n```",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with built-in functions enables Catalyst optimizations, leading to improved performance.  It also reduces serialization overhead as the data does not need to be transferred back and forth between the driver and executors for the UDF execution.  This is particularly beneficial for large datasets."
