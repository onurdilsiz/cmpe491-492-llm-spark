By using mapPartitions(), we can process multiple elements within a partition at once, reducing the function call overhead and improving efficiency.",

            "improvementExplanation": "The map() operation here applies a transformation to each row individually, which can be inefficient for I/O-heavy operations like np.dot(). Using mapPartitions() allows batching of operations within a partition, reducing I/O overhead and improving performance.",
