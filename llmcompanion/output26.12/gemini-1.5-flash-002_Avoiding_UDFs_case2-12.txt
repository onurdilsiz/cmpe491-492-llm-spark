      "operation": "Line 218: `reduce_by_key_func` in `run_job` method",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `reduce_by_key_func` UDF is a simple addition operation.  Spark's built-in `+` operator can directly perform this summation within the `reduceByKey` operation, eliminating the need for a separate UDF and improving performance.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "Replace `reduceByKey(self.reduce_by_key_func)` with `reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a + b)` or simply `reduceByKey(+)`.",
      "benefits": "Eliminating the UDF allows Spark's Catalyst optimizer to better plan the execution, potentially leading to improved performance by avoiding the overhead of UDF serialization and execution.  The built-in `+` operator is highly optimized for this specific task."
    },
    {
      "operation": "Methods `is_wet_text_record`, `is_wat_json_record`, and `is_html`",
      "improvementExplanation": "These UDFs perform conditional checks based on record attributes.  These checks can be efficiently implemented using Spark's built-in filter operations with boolean expressions on the DataFrame columns representing the record attributes. This avoids the overhead of UDF calls and allows for better optimization by the Spark engine.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "Instead of using these UDFs in `iterate_records`, filter the DataFrame directly using `filter` operations with boolean expressions. For example, to replace `is_wet_text_record`, use a filter like: `df.filter((col('rec_type') == 'conversion') & (col('content_type') == 'text/plain'))`",
      "benefits": "Replacing these UDFs with DataFrame filter operations enables Catalyst optimizations, resulting in a more efficient execution plan.  It avoids the overhead of calling Python UDFs for each record, significantly improving performance, especially for large datasets.  It also reduces the serialization overhead associated with data transfer between the driver and executors."
