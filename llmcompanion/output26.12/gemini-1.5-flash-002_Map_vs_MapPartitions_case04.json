            "improvementExplanation": "The map operation splits each line of the customer data. This operation can be performed more efficiently using mapPartitions.  Instead of calling the split function for each line individually, mapPartitions processes multiple lines within a partition at once, reducing the overhead of function calls and potentially improving I/O efficiency by reading and processing data in larger chunks.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "parsed_customer_rdd = customer_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: (line.split(',') for line in iterator))",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions reduces the function call overhead significantly, as the split operation is applied to an iterator of lines within a partition rather than to each line individually. This can lead to substantial performance gains, especially for large datasets.  It also allows for potential optimizations in I/O operations by processing data in larger batches."
