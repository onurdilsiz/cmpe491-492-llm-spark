      "operation": "Line 386: sampleVals = map(NormalGamma.NG.sample, mabArms)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `map(NormalGamma.NG.sample, mabArms)` operation iterates over the `mabArms` list, applying the `NormalGamma.NG.sample` function to each element.  This is an element-wise operation that doesn't require data shuffling or inter-partition communication.  Therefore, it's a good candidate for optimization with `mapPartitions`.  By processing multiple elements within a single partition, we reduce the overhead of repeatedly calling the Python function and potentially improve I/O efficiency if `NormalGamma.NG.sample` involves file access or other external operations.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "sampleVals = mabArms.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: [NormalGamma.NG.sample(x) for x in iterator]).collect()",
      "benefits": "Switching to `mapPartitions` reduces the function call overhead by processing multiple elements within each partition in a batch. This can lead to significant performance gains, especially when the function being applied is computationally expensive or involves I/O operations.  It also improves resource utilization by reducing the context switching between partitions."

      "operation": "Line 412: getWeightVals = map(MultiplicativeWeight.MWU.getWeight, mabArms)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Similar to the previous case, `map(MultiplicativeWeight.MWU.getWeight, mabArms)` applies a function to each element of the `mabArms` list. This is an element-wise operation suitable for optimization with `mapPartitions`. Processing multiple elements within a partition reduces the overhead of repeated function calls and potentially improves I/O efficiency if `MultiplicativeWeight.MWU.getWeight` involves external operations.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "getWeightVals = mabArms.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: [MultiplicativeWeight.MWU.getWeight(x) for x in iterator]).collect()",
      "benefits": "The benefits are the same as in the previous case: reduced function call overhead, potentially improved I/O efficiency, and better resource utilization by processing elements in batches within each partition."
