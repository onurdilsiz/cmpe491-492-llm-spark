            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition(24)` operation is used to explicitly set the number of partitions to 24. This forces a full shuffle of the data across the cluster, regardless of the original number of partitions. In this specific case, the goal is to change the number of partitions to simulate a different cluster configuration. However, since the subsequent operation is a random split, the exact number of partitions is not critical for the correctness of the result. If the goal is to reduce the number of partitions, `coalesce` can be used instead of `repartition`. `coalesce` attempts to reduce the number of partitions without a full shuffle, which can be more efficient. If the number of partitions is increased, `coalesce` will not be able to increase the number of partitions, and `repartition` is required.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "train_repartition_df, val_repartition_df, test_repartition_df = (airbnb_df\n                                             .coalesce(24)\n                                             .randomSplit([.7, .15, .15], seed=42))",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce(24)` from `repartition(24)` can potentially reduce the amount of data shuffling if the original number of partitions is greater than 24. This can lead to improved resource usage and faster job runtime. However, if the original number of partitions is less than 24, `coalesce` will not increase the number of partitions, and the number of partitions will remain the same. In this case, `repartition` is required to increase the number of partitions. If the goal is to reduce the number of partitions, `coalesce` is more efficient than `repartition`."
