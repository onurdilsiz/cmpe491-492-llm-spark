    {
      "operation": "Reading movie names from \"ml-100k/u.ITEM\" file using a text-based format in `loadMovieNames` function (lines 6-11).",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current implementation reads movie names from a text file, which is inefficient for large datasets.  Switching to Parquet or ORC would significantly improve performance.  Parquet and ORC are columnar storage formats that offer better compression and enable predicate pushdown, allowing Spark to read only the necessary columns and rows, resulting in faster query execution.  Since this is a one-time read operation, the performance gain might not be as dramatic as for repeatedly accessed data, but it still offers benefits in terms of reduced I/O and faster loading.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"MovieSimilarities\").getOrCreate()\nmovieNamesDF = spark.read.parquet(\"movie_names.parquet\")\nnameDict = movieNamesDF.rdd.collectAsMap()\n```\n\n**Note:** This requires pre-processing the \"ml-100k/u.ITEM\" file into a Parquet file named \"movie_names.parquet\" using pandas and Spark.  Example:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"ml-100k/u.ITEM\", sep=\"|\", header=None, encoding='latin-1')\ndf = df[[0, 1]]\ndf.columns = [\"movieID\", \"movieName\"]\n\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"MovieSimilarities\").getOrCreate()\nsparkDF = spark.createDataFrame(df)\nsparkDF.write.parquet(\"movie_names.parquet\")\n```",

      "operation": "Saving similarities to \"movie-sims\" using text-based format (commented-out line 60).",
      "improvementExplanation": "The commented-out `saveAsTextFile` operation would write the results to a text file.  This is inefficient for large datasets.  Using Parquet or ORC would result in significantly smaller file sizes and faster read/write operations.  Parquet and ORC's columnar storage and compression capabilities are particularly beneficial for large datasets, leading to improved performance in subsequent reads.",
