            "improvementExplanation": "In this case, the map() transformation is applied to convert transaction amounts from string to float at the element level, which can be inefficient for per-element processing. By using mapPartitions(), we can perform the transformation at the partition level, reducing function call overhead and improving efficiency, especially for I/O-heavy operations.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "amounts_rdd = usd_transactions_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: map(lambda txn: float(txn[1]), partition))",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() can optimize I/O operations by processing data in batches at the partition level, reducing the overhead of function calls for each element. This can lead to improved performance and resource utilization, especially for large datasets."
