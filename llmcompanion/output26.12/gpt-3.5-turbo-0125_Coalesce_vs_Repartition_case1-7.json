            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used to redistribute data across a specified number of partitions based on the '_salted_key'. However, in this context, the operation only aims to reduce the number of partitions without changing the data distribution. Hence, coalesce() can be used instead of repartition() for better efficiency.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df = df.coalesce(number_of_files)\\",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() from repartition() in this scenario will lead to improved resource usage by avoiding unnecessary shuffling of data, resulting in faster job runtime."
