      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation transforms each element (a word) into a key-value pair (word, 1).  This operation is not inherently partition-level; it operates independently on each element. However, since the transformation is simple and lightweight, the overhead of switching to mapPartitions might not significantly improve performance. The benefit would be marginal in this case unless the dataset is extremely large.",

      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions might offer a slight reduction in function call overhead by processing multiple elements within a partition at once. However, the performance gain might be negligible due to the simplicity of the transformation."

      "improvementExplanation": "This map operation swaps the key and value in each key-value pair.  Like the previous case, this is an element-wise operation.  The performance gain from using mapPartitions would likely be minimal unless dealing with a massive dataset. The sortByKey operation is a shuffle operation and dominates the cost, making the map operation's optimization less impactful.",
