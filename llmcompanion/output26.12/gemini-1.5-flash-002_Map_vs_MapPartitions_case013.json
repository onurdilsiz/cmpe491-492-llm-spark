            "improvementExplanation": "The map operation splits each line of the transactions RDD. This operation can be performed more efficiently using mapPartitions.  Instead of calling the split function for each line individually (which incurs significant overhead), mapPartitions processes an entire partition at once. This reduces the function call overhead and allows for potential batching optimizations within the split operation itself.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "parsed_transactions_rdd = transactions_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: (line.split(',') for line in iterator))",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions reduces function call overhead by processing multiple lines within a partition in a single function call. This leads to improved performance, especially for large datasets, by minimizing the interpreter overhead and enabling potential optimizations within the partition processing."
