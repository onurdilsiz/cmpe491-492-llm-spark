    {
      "operation": "df = df.repartition(1000)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame to 1000. However, since the DataFrame is already sorted by `time`, we can achieve the same result with less shuffling by using `coalesce()` instead. `coalesce()` will reduce the number of partitions to the specified number (1 in this case) without shuffling the data.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "df = df.sort(asc('time')).coalesce(1)",
      "benefits": "Replacing `repartition()` with `coalesce()` in this case will reduce the amount of data shuffling, which can improve resource usage and job runtime."
