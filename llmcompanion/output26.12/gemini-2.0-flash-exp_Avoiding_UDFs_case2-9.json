            "operation": "pointToCell function used in inputPoints.mapPartitions(pointToCell) (line 23-31)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `pointToCell` UDF calculates the cell coordinates for each point based on a global `omega` value. This can be achieved using Spark's built-in functions like `floor` and arithmetic operations within a `map` transformation, avoiding the overhead of a UDF. The `mapPartitions` is not needed since we are not doing any per-partition aggregation.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "```python\nomega = D/(2*math.sqrt(2))\ncells_counts = inputPoints.map(lambda point: ( (int(math.floor(point[0] / omega)), int(math.floor(point[1] / omega))), 1)).reduceByKey(lambda a,b: a + b)\n```",
            "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with built-in functions allows Spark's Catalyst optimizer to optimize the execution plan, potentially leading to performance improvements. It also avoids the serialization overhead associated with UDFs."

            "improvementExplanation": "The `region_counts7` UDF calculates the sum of counts within a 7x7 region around a given cell. This operation can be performed using a join operation with a generated set of neighboring cells and then aggregating the counts. This avoids the need for a UDF and allows for better optimization by Spark.",
