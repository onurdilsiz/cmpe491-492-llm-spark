            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition()` operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the RDD to match the number of workers. However, since the RDD is already partitioned, using `coalesce()` instead would achieve the same goal of distributing the data across the workers without incurring the overhead of a full shuffle. This would result in reduced shuffling, improved resource usage, and faster job runtime.",

            "benefits": "Reduced shuffling, improved resource usage, and faster job runtime."
