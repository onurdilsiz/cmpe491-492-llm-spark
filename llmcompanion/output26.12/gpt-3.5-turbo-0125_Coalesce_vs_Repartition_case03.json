            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(4) operation is used to increase the number of partitions to 4 for the department_salary_rdd. However, in this context, reducing the partitions using coalesce() can be more efficient as it avoids a full shuffle.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "department_salary_rdd = parsed_employee_rdd.map(lambda emp: (emp[2], float(emp[3]))).coalesce(4)",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce(4) instead of repartition(4) will reduce shuffling overhead, improve resource usage, and potentially lead to faster job execution."
