            "operation": "The `as_block_matrix` function (lines 10-14) converts an RDD of vectors into an `IndexedRowMatrix` and then to a `BlockMatrix`.",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `as_block_matrix` function is a UDF that performs transformations on an RDD.  Spark's built-in functions and DataFrame/Dataset operations are optimized for distributed processing and can significantly improve performance compared to UDFs.  In this case, the conversion to `IndexedRowMatrix` and `BlockMatrix` can be achieved using Spark's `mllib` functionalities directly on the RDD without the need for a separate UDF.  However, the core RBM logic heavily relies on NumPy operations which are not directly compatible with Spark's distributed nature.  Therefore, a complete replacement is not straightforward and would require a significant restructuring of the RBM implementation to leverage Spark's built-in matrix operations effectively.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "A direct replacement isn't feasible without major code restructuring.  To improve performance, consider exploring Spark's `mllib` libraries for matrix operations that can work directly with RDDs, minimizing data transfer between the driver and executors. This would involve rewriting the RBM algorithm to use Spark's distributed matrix operations instead of NumPy.",
            "benefits": "Avoiding UDFs in this context would enable Catalyst optimizations, leading to improved performance by allowing Spark to push down operations into the execution plan.  It would also reduce serialization overhead, as data wouldn't need to be repeatedly transferred between the driver and executors for UDF execution.  The use of Spark's built-in matrix operations would further enhance performance by leveraging its optimized distributed algorithms."
