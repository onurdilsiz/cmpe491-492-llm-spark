**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of User-Defined Functions (UDFs). The code primarily focuses on downloading files from URLs and storing them in HDFS using the `urllib2` library and `hadoop fs` commands. The `download` function reads a text file containing URLs, repartitions it for parallel processing, and iterates over each URL to download the corresponding file. The `getForm` function handles individual file downloads, writes the downloaded content to a local file, and then uses the `hadoop fs` command to store the file in HDFS.

Since there are no UDFs present in the code, the remaining fields in the JSON response are empty.
