            "operation": "Reading data from CSV file at line 133: `rawData = sc.textFile(data_path).repartition(numPartitions=L)`",
            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a CSV file using `sc.textFile()`.  CSV is a text-based format, leading to slower read/write speeds and higher storage costs compared to binary formats like Parquet or ORC. Parquet and ORC offer significant performance advantages due to their columnar storage, compression, and efficient metadata handling.  Switching to Parquet or ORC would enable faster data loading, reduced storage space, and improved query performance, especially for large datasets.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName('G064HW2').getOrCreate()\ndataFrame = spark.read.parquet(data_path).repartition(numPartitions=L)\ninputPoints = dataFrame.rdd.map(lambda row: [float(i) for i in row])\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC offers the following benefits:\n- **Faster read/write speeds:** Parquet and ORC are significantly faster than CSV for both reading and writing data.\n- **Improved compression:** Parquet and ORC provide better compression ratios than CSV, reducing storage costs and network transfer times.\n- **Columnar storage:** Parquet and ORC use columnar storage, allowing for efficient processing of only the necessary columns, leading to faster query execution.\n- **Predicate pushdown:** Parquet and ORC support predicate pushdown, enabling Spark to filter data at the storage level, further improving query performance."
