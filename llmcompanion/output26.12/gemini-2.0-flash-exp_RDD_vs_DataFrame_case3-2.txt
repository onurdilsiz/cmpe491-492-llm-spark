      "improvementExplanation": "The code converts the DataFrame `filtered_df` back to an RDD to save it as a text file. This is inefficient because DataFrames are optimized for structured data and provide better performance for operations like saving to a file. Converting to an RDD and then back to a text file bypasses these optimizations.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "Instead of converting to an RDD, the DataFrame can be directly saved as a CSV file using the DataFrame's `write` API. This avoids the overhead of RDD conversion and leverages the optimized DataFrame writer.",
      "benefits": "By directly writing the DataFrame to a CSV file, we avoid the unnecessary conversion to an RDD, which involves serialization and deserialization overhead. The DataFrame's write API is optimized for writing structured data, leading to better performance and resource utilization. This approach also simplifies the code and makes it more readable. Additionally, the DataFrame writer can handle various output formats and options, providing more flexibility."
