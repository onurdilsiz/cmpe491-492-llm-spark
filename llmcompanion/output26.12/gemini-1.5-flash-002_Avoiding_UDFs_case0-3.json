            "improvementExplanation": "The UDFs `seqOp2` and `combOp2` perform a custom aggregation. While a direct replacement with a single built-in function isn't possible, this aggregation can be achieved using `reduce` with a custom function or by transforming the RDD into a DataFrame and using built-in aggregate functions.",
