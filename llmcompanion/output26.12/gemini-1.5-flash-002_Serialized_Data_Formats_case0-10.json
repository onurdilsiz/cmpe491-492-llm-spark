            "improvementExplanation": "The current input method loads data from a Python list, which is inefficient for large datasets.  Using a serialized format like Parquet or ORC allows for efficient storage and retrieval of data from disk.  Parquet and ORC support columnar storage, compression, and predicate pushdown, leading to significant performance improvements.",

            "operation": "Lines 38-42: Writing the DataFrame to the console using the show() method. This is an implicit output operation, where data is displayed to the user.",
            "improvementExplanation": "The show() method is primarily for debugging and displaying small amounts of data. For large datasets, writing to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC is significantly more efficient.  This allows for persistence of the data and faster access in subsequent operations.",

            "benefits": "Faster data writing, efficient storage, compression, and the ability to reuse the data in subsequent Spark jobs without recomputation."
