            "improvementExplanation": "In this context, map() is used to split each element by space, resulting in a new element for each word. This operation can be performed more efficiently at the partition level using mapPartitions() to reduce function call overhead.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "rdd2 = rdd.mapPartitions(lambda iter: (x for word in iter for x in word.split(\" \")))",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() can optimize the splitting operation by processing multiple elements in a batch within each partition, reducing the overhead of invoking the function for each element individually. This can lead to improved performance, especially for I/O-heavy operations or transformations that benefit from processing data in larger chunks."
