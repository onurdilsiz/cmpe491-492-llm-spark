      "operation": "Reading data from a text file using `sc.textFile()` on line 34.",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current data format is a text file, which is not optimized for Spark processing. Reading data from a text file can be slow and inefficient, especially for large datasets. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be read and processed.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read data from a Parquet file\ninputPoints = sc.read.parquet(data_path).repartition(numPartitions=L)\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC will provide the following benefits:\n* **Faster reads/writes:** Parquet and ORC are columnar formats that store data in a compressed and efficient manner, which allows for faster reads and writes compared to text files.\n* **Compression:** Parquet and ORC support compression, which can significantly reduce the storage space required for the data.\n* **Query optimization:** Parquet and ORC support predicate pushdown, which allows Spark to filter data at the file level, further improving query performance."
