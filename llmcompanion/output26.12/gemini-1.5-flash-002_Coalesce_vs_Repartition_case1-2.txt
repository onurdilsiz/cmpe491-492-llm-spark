      "improvementExplanation": "The provided code uses `repartition(1)` before writing the data to a CSV file.  Since the goal is to write the data to a single file, using `repartition(1)` causes a full shuffle, which is unnecessary.  `coalesce(1)` can achieve the same result without the shuffle, as it only reduces the number of partitions without shuffling data.  The number of partitions is reduced to 1, which is ideal for writing to a single file.  The data is already in memory, so no shuffle is needed to combine it into a single partition.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "df2.coalesce(1).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/coalesce/1\")",
      "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce(1)` eliminates the unnecessary full shuffle performed by `repartition(1)`. This leads to significantly reduced execution time, lower resource consumption (CPU and network), and improved overall job performance. The data is written to a single file, which is the desired outcome."
