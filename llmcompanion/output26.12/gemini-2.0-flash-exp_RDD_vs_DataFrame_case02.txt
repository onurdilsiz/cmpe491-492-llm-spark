      "improvementExplanation": "Reading data as an RDD and then parsing it with `map` is inefficient. DataFrames can directly read structured data and infer schemas, avoiding manual parsing and enabling Spark's Catalyst optimizer.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "employee_df = spark.read.csv(\"path/to/employees.txt\", header=False, inferSchema=True).toDF(\"employee_id\", \"name\", \"salary\")",
      "benefits": "Directly reading into a DataFrame allows Spark to infer the schema, which is more efficient than parsing each line with a map function. It also enables Catalyst optimizer to perform query optimizations."
    },
    {
      "rddOperation": "high_salary_rdd = parsed_employee_rdd.filter(lambda emp: float(emp[2]) > 50000)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Filtering an RDD using a lambda function is less efficient than using DataFrame's built-in filtering capabilities. DataFrames can leverage predicate pushdown and other optimizations.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "high_salary_df = employee_df.filter(employee_df[\"salary\"] > 50000)",
      "benefits": "DataFrame's filter operation is optimized for performance. It allows Spark to push the filter predicate down to the data source, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed. This leads to faster execution and reduced resource usage."

      "rddOperation": "bonus_rdd = high_salary_rdd.map(lambda emp: (emp[0], emp[1], float(emp[2]) * 1.1))",
      "improvementExplanation": "Applying a transformation using `map` on an RDD is less efficient than using DataFrame's `withColumn` or `select` operations. DataFrames can perform these operations more efficiently by leveraging the Catalyst optimizer.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "bonus_df = high_salary_df.withColumn(\"bonus_salary\", high_salary_df[\"salary\"] * 1.1)",
      "benefits": "Using `withColumn` or `select` on a DataFrame allows Spark to optimize the transformation. It can perform the calculation in a more efficient manner than a map function on an RDD. This leads to better performance and resource utilization."
