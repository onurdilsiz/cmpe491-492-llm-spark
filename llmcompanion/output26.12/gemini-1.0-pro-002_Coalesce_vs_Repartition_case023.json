            "operation": "repartition() is used in line 14 to reduce the number of partitions in the `taxed_orders_df` DataFrame.",
            "improvementExplanation": "In this case, `repartition()` is used to reduce the number of partitions in the `taxed_orders_df` DataFrame. However, since we are not performing any shuffle operations after this point, we can use `coalesce()` instead to achieve the same result without incurring the overhead of a full shuffle. This will improve the efficiency of the job by reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred across the network.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "```python\ntaxed_orders_df = taxed_orders_df.coalesce(4)  # Reduce the number of partitions to 4\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce()` in this case will provide the following benefits:\n* **Reduced shuffling:** By avoiding a full shuffle, we can significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred across the network, leading to faster job execution.\n* **Improved resource usage:** `coalesce()` is a more efficient operation than `repartition()`, as it does not require shuffling data. This can lead to better resource utilization and lower costs.\n* **Faster runtime:** The overall runtime of the job will be improved by reducing the amount of time spent on shuffling data."
