            "operation": "repartitioned_df = error_logs_df.repartition(10)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(10) operation is used to increase the number of partitions to 10, which can be inefficient as it triggers a full shuffle. Since the goal is to reduce the number of partitions for writing to a CSV file, coalesce() can be used instead to minimize shuffling.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "coalesced_df = error_logs_df.coalesce(1)",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce(1) reduces shuffling by minimizing data movement across partitions, leading to improved resource usage and faster job runtime."
