      "operation": "Reading data from a text file (numbers.txt) using spark.sparkContext.textFile() on line 12.",
      "improvementExplanation": "The current data format is a plain text file, which is not optimized for Spark processing. Reading data from text files can be slow and inefficient. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can significantly improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be read and processed.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read data from a Parquet file\nparquet_file = spark.read.parquet(input_file)\n```",
      "benefits": "Using Parquet or ORC offers several benefits:\n* **Faster reads/writes:** Serialized formats like Parquet and ORC are optimized for reading and writing data efficiently.\n* **Compression:** Parquet and ORC support compression, which can significantly reduce the amount of storage space required.\n* **Query optimization:** Parquet and ORC allow for predicate pushdown, which means that filters can be applied directly to the data files, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed."

      "operation": "Writing data to the console using print() on line 23.",
      "improvementExplanation": "While writing to the console is useful for debugging, it is not an efficient way to store or analyze data. Consider writing the results to a file in a serialized format like Parquet or ORC for further analysis or storage.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Write data to a Parquet file\nfinalrdd.write.parquet(\"output.parquet\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Writing data to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC offers the same benefits as reading from a serialized format: faster reads/writes, compression, and query optimization."
