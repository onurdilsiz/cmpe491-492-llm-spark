```json
{
  "detected": false,
  "occurrences": 0,
  "response": []
}
```

**Explanation:**

The provided Spark code does not contain any instances of User-Defined Functions (UDFs). Therefore, the response object is empty, indicating that no UDFs were detected.

**Additional Notes:**

* The code snippet demonstrates inefficient RDD processing, unnecessary repartitioning, and the use of a non-optimized data format (CSV). These aspects could be improved for better performance and efficiency.
* While UDFs are not used in this specific code, it's important to understand their potential drawbacks and consider using built-in functions or native DataFrame/Dataset operations whenever possible.
* Replacing UDFs with built-in functions or native operations can lead to significant performance improvements, reduced serialization overhead, and enable Catalyst optimizations.
