      "improvementExplanation": "The `map` operation is used to split each line of the input RDD into a list of strings. This operation can be performed more efficiently using `mapPartitions` because the splitting logic can be applied to a batch of lines within a partition, reducing the overhead of calling the lambda function for each individual line. Instead of processing each line individually, `mapPartitions` allows us to process an iterator of lines within each partition, which can be more efficient for operations like string splitting.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "parsed_sales_rdd = sales_rdd.mapPartitions(lambda lines: (line.split(\",\") for line in lines))",
      "benefits": "Switching to `mapPartitions` reduces the function call overhead because the lambda function is called once per partition instead of once per element. This can lead to significant performance improvements, especially when dealing with large datasets. Additionally, if the splitting logic were more complex or involved I/O operations, `mapPartitions` would allow for more efficient batch processing within each partition."
