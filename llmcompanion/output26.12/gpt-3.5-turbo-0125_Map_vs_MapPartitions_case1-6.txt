            "improvementExplanation": "The withColumn() transformation is applied row by row using map(), which can be inefficient for large datasets. By using mapPartitions(), we can process multiple rows at once within each partition, reducing function call overhead and improving performance.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "df2 = df1.rdd.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: ([row.withColumn(...) for row in iterator]))",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() can optimize the processing of multiple rows within each partition, leading to reduced function call overhead, improved resource utilization, and potentially faster execution for row-wise operations like withColumn()."
