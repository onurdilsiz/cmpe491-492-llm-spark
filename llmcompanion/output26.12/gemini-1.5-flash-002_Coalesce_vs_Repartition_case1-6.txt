      "improvementExplanation": "The provided code uses `repartition(200)` before writing the data to CSV.  Repartitioning is used to increase the number of partitions to 200. However, since the goal is to write the data to a file system, the number of partitions only affects the number of files written.  If the number of partitions in `df_5years` is less than 200, `repartition` will perform a full shuffle to redistribute the data. If the number of partitions is already greater than or equal to 200, it will still perform unnecessary operations.  `coalesce` can reduce the number of partitions without shuffling if the target number of partitions is less than or equal to the current number of partitions. In this case, using `coalesce` would be more efficient if the initial number of partitions is greater than 200, or if the number of partitions doesn't need to be exactly 200.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "df_5years.coalesce(200).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").mode(\"overwrite\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000-2005/coalesce/200\")",
      "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce` can significantly reduce the shuffle time and improve overall performance, especially if the initial number of partitions is already greater than or equal to 200.  It reduces resource consumption and speeds up the write operation.  The job will complete faster due to less data movement."
