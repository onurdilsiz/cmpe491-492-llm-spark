            "improvementExplanation": "The current code reads data from a REST API using the `requests` library, which is not an optimized format for Spark. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve performance by reducing the need to parse and deserialize data on each read.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read data from a Parquet file\nparquet_df = spark.read.parquet(\"path/to/parquet/file\")\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC would provide the following benefits:\n* **Faster reads/writes:** Serialized formats are optimized for reading and writing large datasets, resulting in significantly faster performance compared to reading from a REST API.\n* **Compression:** Serialized formats like Parquet and ORC use compression techniques to reduce the size of the data on disk, saving storage space and improving network transfer times.\n* **Query optimization:** Spark can leverage the metadata and schema information stored in serialized formats to optimize query execution, leading to faster query response times."
