            "improvementExplanation": "The `map` operation here splits each line of the log file by comma. While this works, it processes each line individually. If the splitting logic could be applied to a batch of lines at once, it would be more efficient. `mapPartitions` allows us to process each partition as a whole, which can reduce the overhead of calling the lambda function for each individual line.",

            "improvementExplanation": "This `map` operation extracts the timestamp (first element) from each log entry. Similar to the previous case, this is a per-element operation. Using `mapPartitions` would allow us to process the extraction logic on a partition level, reducing the overhead of calling the lambda function for each log entry.",
