      "operation": "repartitioned_df = usd_transactions_df.repartition(10)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code uses `repartition(10)` to increase the number of partitions to 10.  This forces a full shuffle of the data, regardless of the initial number of partitions. If the goal is to simply reduce the number of partitions (e.g., for writing to a file system), and the initial number of partitions is greater than 10, `coalesce` would be more efficient as it avoids unnecessary shuffling.  It only performs a shuffle if the target number of partitions is greater than the current number. If the initial number of partitions is less than or equal to 10, `coalesce` will not perform any shuffle at all.",
      "coalesceEquivalent": "repartitioned_df = usd_transactions_df.coalesce(10)",
      "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce(10)` offers significant performance gains when the initial number of partitions is greater than 10. It avoids the full data shuffle required by `repartition()`, leading to reduced execution time, lower resource consumption (CPU, memory, network), and improved overall job efficiency. If the initial partition count is less than or equal to 10, `coalesce` will be even faster as it will not perform any shuffle."
