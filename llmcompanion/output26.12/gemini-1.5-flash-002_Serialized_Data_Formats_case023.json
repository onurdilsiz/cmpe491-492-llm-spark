            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads order data from a text file (orders.txt) using RDDs.  This is inefficient for large datasets.  Switching to Parquet or ORC would significantly improve performance.  Parquet and ORC are columnar storage formats that offer better compression and enable predicate pushdown for faster query processing.  They also support schema enforcement, leading to better data integrity.",
