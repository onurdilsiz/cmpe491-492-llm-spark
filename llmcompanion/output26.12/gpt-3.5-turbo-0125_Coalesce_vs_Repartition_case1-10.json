            "improvementExplanation": "In this context, repartition(10) is used to evenly distribute the data into 10 partitions for parallel processing. However, since the goal is not to increase the number of partitions but to optimize the distribution, coalesce(10) can be used instead to minimize shuffling.",

            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce(10) from repartition(10) will reduce unnecessary shuffling, leading to improved resource utilization, faster job execution, and less strain on the cluster."
