            "alternativeEquivalent": "Instead of using the eval_metrics UDF, you can calculate the metrics directly using Spark DataFrame operations. For example, to calculate RMSE, MAE, and R2 in Spark:",
            "benefits": "By avoiding UDFs and utilizing native Spark operations, you enable Catalyst optimizations, improve performance by leveraging Spark's distributed processing capabilities, and reduce serialization overhead."
