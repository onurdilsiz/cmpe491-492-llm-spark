      "operation": "The UDF `reduce_by_key_func` is used in the `run_job` method on line 144 to reduce the output of the `mapPartitionsWithIndex` operation.",
      "improvementExplanation": "The `reduce_by_key_func` UDF can be replaced with the built-in Spark function `reduceByKey` because it performs the same operation of summing values for each key. This replacement will enable Catalyst optimizations and improve performance.",
      "alternativeEquivalent": "```python\noutput = input_data.mapPartitionsWithIndex(self.process_warcs) \\n            .reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a + b)  # Replace UDF with reduceByKey\n```",
      "benefits": "Replacing the UDF with a built-in function will enable Catalyst optimizations, improve performance, and reduce serialization overhead."
