            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(2) operation is used to redistribute data across a specified number of partitions. In this case, the repartition(2) is used after the reduceByKey operation to control the number of output partitions. Since the data is already shuffled by reduceByKey, using coalesce(2) instead of repartition(2) can avoid a full shuffle and improve efficiency.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "rdd4 = rdd3.reduceByKey(lambda a,b: a+b).coalesce(2)",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce(2) from repartition(2) can reduce unnecessary shuffling, optimize resource utilization, and potentially lead to faster job execution."
