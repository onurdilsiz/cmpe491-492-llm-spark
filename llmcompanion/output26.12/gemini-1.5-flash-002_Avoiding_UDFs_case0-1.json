            "operation": "def loadMovieNames(): ... (lines 5-11)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The `loadMovieNames` function reads a file into a dictionary. This can be replaced by a Spark broadcast variable for efficiency.  Broadcasting avoids redundant file reads on each executor.",

            "benefits": "Using broadcast variables avoids redundant I/O operations across the cluster, improving performance and reducing network traffic.  It also allows for better data locality."

            "improvementExplanation": "The `computeCosineSimilarity` UDF calculates cosine similarity. While a direct replacement with a single built-in function isn't available, Spark's MLlib library provides efficient implementations for similarity calculations.  For this specific case, a custom aggregation function within the DataFrame API might be more efficient than a UDF.",
