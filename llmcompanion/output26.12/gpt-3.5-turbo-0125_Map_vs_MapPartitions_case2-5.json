            "operation": "lemmatized = plainText.mapPartitions(lemmaMapper)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The map() transformation is used to apply the lemmaMapper function to each element individually, which can lead to high function call overhead. By using mapPartitions(), we can process multiple elements within a partition at once, reducing the overhead and improving efficiency, especially for I/O-heavy operations like NLP processing.",

            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() can reduce function call overhead and optimize I/O operations by processing multiple elements in a partition at once, leading to improved performance for NLP processing."
