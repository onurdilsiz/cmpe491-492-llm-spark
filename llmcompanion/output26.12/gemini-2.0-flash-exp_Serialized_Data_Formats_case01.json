            "operation": "Reading from text file: `sales_rdd = spark.sparkContext.textFile(\"path/to/sales.txt\")`",
            "improvementExplanation": "The code currently reads data from a text file (`sales.txt`). Text files are not optimized for analytical workloads. They lack schema information, require parsing for each read, and do not support efficient compression or predicate pushdown. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve performance. Parquet is generally preferred for its wide support and good balance of performance and compression.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\n# Initialize Spark session\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"BadPracticesExample_1_2\").master(\"local[*]\").getOrCreate()\n\n# Read data from Parquet file\nsales_df = spark.read.parquet(\"path/to/sales.parquet\")\n\n# Filter for 'Electronics' category\nelectronics_sales_df = sales_df.filter(sales_df[\"category\"] == \"Electronics\")\n\n# Count the number of electronics sales\nelectronics_sales_count = electronics_sales_df.count()\nprint(f\"Number of Electronics sales: {electronics_sales_count}\")\n\n# Repartitioning is still inefficient, but kept for demonstration\nrepartitioned_df = electronics_sales_df.repartition(10)\nprint(\"Number of partitions after repartition:\", repartitioned_df.rdd.getNumPartitions())\n\n# Stop Spark session\nspark.stop()\n```\n\nNote: This assumes that the `sales.txt` file has been converted to `sales.parquet` beforehand. The conversion can be done using Spark as well, for example:\n\n```python\n# Assuming sales_rdd is the RDD from the original code\nsales_df = sales_rdd.map(lambda line: line.split(\",\")).toDF([\"sale_id\", \"amount\", \"category\"])\nsales_df.write.parquet(\"path/to/sales.parquet\")\n```",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet offers several benefits:\n- **Faster Reads:** Parquet is a columnar format, allowing Spark to read only the necessary columns for a query, reducing I/O.\n- **Schema Awareness:** Parquet stores schema information, eliminating the need for parsing during reads.\n- **Compression:** Parquet supports efficient compression algorithms, reducing storage space and I/O.\n- **Predicate Pushdown:** Spark can push down filters to the data source, reducing the amount of data read from disk.\n- **Type Safety:** Parquet stores data types, which can prevent errors during data processing."
