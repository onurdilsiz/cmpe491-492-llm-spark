            "improvementExplanation": "The map() transformation is used to extract a substring from each row in the DataFrame. This operation can be more efficiently performed at the partition level using mapPartitions() to reduce function call overhead.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "df2 = df1.rdd.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: ([row[5:11]] for row in iterator)).toDF()",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() can optimize the substring extraction operation by processing multiple rows in each partition, reducing the overhead of function calls and potentially improving performance for I/O-heavy operations."
