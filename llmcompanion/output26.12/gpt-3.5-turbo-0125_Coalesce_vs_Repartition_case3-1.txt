            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation here is used to split the DataFrame into training and validation sets. Since the operation does not require a full shuffle and only aims to reduce the number of partitions, coalesce() can be used for better efficiency.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df_train = df_train.coalesce(4)\ndf_val = df_val.coalesce(1)",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() reduces unnecessary shuffling, improves resource usage by minimizing data movement, and can lead to faster job execution."
