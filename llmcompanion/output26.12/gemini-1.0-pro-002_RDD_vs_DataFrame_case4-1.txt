      "improvementExplanation": "The `map` operation is used to transform each element of an RDD. However, DataFrames/Datasets offer a more efficient and optimized way to perform transformations using SQL-like expressions.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\nrequest_df.select(col('verb'), col('url'), col('headers'), col('body'), udf_executeRestApi(col('verb'), col('url'), col('headers'), col('body')).alias('execute'))\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to DataFrame/Dataset for the `map` operation provides the following benefits:\n- **Query optimizations:** DataFrames/Datasets leverage Spark's Catalyst Optimizer, which can significantly improve query performance by optimizing the execution plan.\n- **Reduced shuffling:** DataFrames/Datasets minimize data shuffling between partitions, leading to faster execution times.\n- **Better resource usage:** DataFrames/Datasets efficiently utilize cluster resources, reducing memory consumption and improving overall performance."
