      "operation": "Reading text data from HDFS using `spark.read.text()` at line 14.",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a text file in HDFS.  Text files are not optimized for Spark processing.  They lack schema information, leading to increased processing overhead.  Switching to Parquet or ORC provides schema enforcement, efficient compression, and enables predicate pushdown for faster query execution.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\ndf1 = spark.read.parquet(\"hdfs://namenode/user/controller/ncdc-orig/2000-2018.parquet\")\n```\n\nNote: This assumes the data has been pre-processed and saved as a Parquet file.  Conversion would involve writing the data to Parquet format first.",
      "benefits": "Faster read speeds, efficient compression (reducing storage costs and network transfer times), schema enforcement, and improved query performance due to predicate pushdown."

      "operation": "Writing data to CSV in HDFS using `df_5years.repartition(1).write.format(\"csv\").option(\"compression\",\"lz4\").mode(\"overwrite\").option(\"header\",\"true\").save(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000-2005/repartition/1\")` at lines 50-52.",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code writes data to a CSV file with LZ4 compression. While LZ4 provides some compression, Parquet or ORC offer significantly better compression ratios and faster read/write performance.  They also support columnar storage, enabling faster access to specific columns.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\ndf_5years.repartition(1).write.parquet(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000-2005/repartition/1\", mode=\"overwrite\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Significantly faster write speeds, higher compression ratios (reducing storage costs and network transfer times), columnar storage for faster access to specific columns, and improved query performance."
