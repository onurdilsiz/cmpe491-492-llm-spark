    {
      "rddOperation": "map(lambda line: line.split(\",\"))",
      "improvementExplanation": "This RDD operation parses each line of the log file into a list of strings. This can be done more efficiently using the DataFrame/Dataset API's built-in parsing capabilities.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "```python\nerror_logs_df = spark.read.text(\"path/to/logs.txt\").selectExpr(\"split(value, ',')[0] as timestamp\", \"split(value, ',')[1] as level\", \"split(value, ',')[2] as message\")\n```",
      "benefits": "This change will improve performance by avoiding the overhead of creating an RDD and using the map function. It will also reduce the amount of data that needs to be shuffled."

      "rddOperation": "filter(lambda log: log[1] == \"ERROR\")",
