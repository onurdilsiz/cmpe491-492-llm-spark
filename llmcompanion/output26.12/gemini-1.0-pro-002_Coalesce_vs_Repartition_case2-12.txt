      "improvementExplanation": "This repartition() operation is used to increase the number of partitions in the DataFrame. However, since the subsequent operation is coalesce(), which reduces the number of partitions, it is more efficient to use coalesce() directly instead of repartitioning and then coalescing. This will avoid unnecessary shuffling and improve resource usage.",

      "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() will reduce shuffling, improve resource usage, and potentially lead to faster job runtime."
