            "operation": "Reading from text file: `orders_rdd = spark.sparkContext.textFile(\"path/to/orders.txt\")`",
            "improvementExplanation": "The code reads order data from a text file. While this is simple, text files are not optimized for analytical workloads. Each line needs to be parsed, which is inefficient. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance, especially for large datasets, as it allows for predicate pushdown and efficient data skipping.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\norders_df = spark.read.parquet(\"path/to/orders.parquet\")\n# Assuming the parquet file has columns: order_id, customer_id, amount, category\n```",
            "benefits": "Parquet or ORC offer faster reads due to columnar storage, compression, and predicate pushdown, which allows Spark to read only the necessary columns and rows. This reduces I/O and improves query performance."

            "improvementExplanation": "The code saves the processed order data in CSV format. CSV is a row-based text format, which is not efficient for analytical workloads. It lacks schema information and requires parsing on read. Switching to a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would improve write performance and subsequent read performance, especially if the data is used for further analysis.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\ntaxed_orders_df.write.format(\"parquet\").save(\"path/to/taxed_orders_output.parquet\")\n```",
            "benefits": "Parquet or ORC offer faster writes due to columnar storage and compression. They also provide schema information, eliminating the need for parsing on read. This leads to faster data loading and improved query performance. Additionally, they support predicate pushdown, which can further optimize queries."
