            "improvementExplanation": "The map() transformation is used to select specific columns from the DataFrame 'pred_row'. This operation can be performed more efficiently at the partition level using mapPartitions() to avoid repeated function calls for each row.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "pred_row = pred_row.rdd.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: map(lambda x: [x[col] for col in file_contents], iterator)).toDF(file_contents)",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() can reduce function call overhead by processing multiple rows at once within each partition. This can lead to improved performance, especially for I/O-heavy operations, by minimizing the overhead associated with processing individual rows."
