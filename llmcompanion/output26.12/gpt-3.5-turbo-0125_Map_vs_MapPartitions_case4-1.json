            "improvementExplanation": "In this case, the map() transformation is used to explode the array column 'execute.Results' into individual rows. Since this operation can be performed at the partition level without the need to process each row individually, using mapPartitions() can improve efficiency by reducing function call overhead.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "request_df.rdd.mapPartitions(lambda it: (row.results for row in it)).toDF()",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() can optimize the processing of exploding array columns by operating at the partition level, leading to reduced function call overhead, improved performance for partition-level operations, and potentially better resource utilization."
