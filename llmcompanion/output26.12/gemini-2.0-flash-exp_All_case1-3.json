            "improvementExplanation": "The `repartition(200)` operation forces a full shuffle of the data, which can be expensive. If the goal is to reduce the number of partitions from a larger number to 200, and not necessarily to redistribute the data across partitions, `coalesce(200)` can be used instead. `coalesce` avoids a full shuffle if the number of target partitions is less than the current number of partitions.",

            "benefits": "Switching to `coalesce` reduces shuffling, which improves resource usage and job runtime, especially when reducing the number of partitions."
