            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(10) operation performs a full shuffle, which is expensive. Since the goal is likely to improve data locality for the subsequent foreachPartition, coalesce() would be more efficient if the number of partitions is already greater than or equal to 10. If the number of partitions is less than 10, repartition is necessary.",

            "improvementExplanation": "The getForm function performs file downloads and HDFS operations within a foreachPartition. This is inefficient because it mixes data processing with I/O operations.  Spark's built-in functions for file I/O and HDFS interaction should be used instead of custom UDFs.",
            "alternativeEquivalent": "This requires a more substantial rewrite to leverage Spark's capabilities for distributed file handling.  A solution would involve using Spark's built-in functions to handle the downloads and HDFS uploads in a more distributed and efficient manner.  This might involve using libraries like `requests` within a `mapPartitions` operation and leveraging Spark's `hadoop` integration for file system operations.",
