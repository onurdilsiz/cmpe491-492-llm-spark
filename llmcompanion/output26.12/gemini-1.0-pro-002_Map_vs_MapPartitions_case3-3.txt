      "operation": "Filling the Missing Values with \"Missing\" (line 17)",
      "improvementExplanation": "The operation of filling missing values with a constant value like \"Missing\" is a good candidate for mapPartitions() because it can be performed efficiently on a per-partition basis. This avoids unnecessary function calls and I/O operations compared to using map().",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\n# Using mapPartitions() for efficient missing value filling\ndf_pyspark = df_pyspark.rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: (\n    [row if row['Experience'] is not None else row.asDict() | {'Experience': 'Missing'} for row in partition]\n))\n```",
      "benefits": "Replacing map() with mapPartitions() in this case offers several benefits:\n\n* **Reduced function call overhead:** mapPartitions() avoids calling the filling function for each individual row, reducing the overall function call overhead.\n* **Optimized I/O:** By processing data in partitions, mapPartitions() minimizes unnecessary I/O operations, as the filling operation is performed within each partition.\n* **Improved resource utilization:** mapPartitions() can potentially improve resource utilization by distributing the workload across multiple partitions, leading to faster processing times."
