            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(10) operation is used to increase the number of partitions to 10. However, in this context, the operation does not require a full shuffle as it only aims to reduce the number of partitions. Using coalesce(10) instead of repartition(10) will avoid unnecessary shuffling of data across the cluster.",

            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce(10) will reduce shuffling overhead, improve resource utilization by minimizing data movement, and potentially lead to faster job execution."
