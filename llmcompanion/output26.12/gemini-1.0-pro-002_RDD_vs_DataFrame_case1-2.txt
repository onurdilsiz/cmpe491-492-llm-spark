**Explanation:**

The provided code snippet does not utilize RDDs. It exclusively employs DataFrames for data manipulation and processing. Therefore, there are no opportunities to replace RDDs with DataFrames for performance enhancement. 

The code effectively leverages DataFrames for various operations, including:

- Reading data from a text file using `spark.read.text`
- Extracting specific columns and transforming data types using `withColumn`
- Writing the processed data to CSV and Parquet formats using `write.format`

DataFrames offer significant advantages over RDDs in terms of:

- **Performance:** DataFrames are optimized for query execution, leveraging Spark's Catalyst optimizer for efficient query planning and execution.
- **Scalability:** DataFrames can handle large datasets efficiently due to their distributed nature and ability to leverage multiple nodes in a cluster.
- **Ease of Use:** DataFrames provide a more intuitive and user-friendly API for data manipulation, making it easier to write and maintain code.
- **Resource Efficiency:** DataFrames minimize data shuffling and unnecessary computations, leading to reduced resource consumption.

In conclusion, the provided code snippet demonstrates effective utilization of DataFrames for data processing, maximizing performance and efficiency without the need for RDD-based operations.
