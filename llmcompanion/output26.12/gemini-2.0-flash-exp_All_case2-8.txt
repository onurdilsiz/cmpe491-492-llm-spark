The RDD is created from the input data, which is assumed to be a collection of (feature, label) pairs. We can convert this to a DataFrame with two columns, 'features' and 'labels', and then use DataFrame operations for the training process. This allows Spark to optimize the execution plan and potentially reduce shuffling.",
