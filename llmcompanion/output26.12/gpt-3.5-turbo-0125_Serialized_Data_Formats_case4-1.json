            "improvementExplanation": "The current data format being used is JSON obtained from an HTTP GET request. Switching to a serialized format like Parquet or ORC can improve performance by providing better compression, faster reads/writes, and enabling predicate pushdown optimizations.",
            "optimizedEquivalent": "Instead of directly fetching JSON data from an HTTP GET request, consider storing the data in Parquet format for optimized performance.",
            "benefits": "Switching to Parquet format can lead to faster reads/writes, efficient storage due to columnar storage, better compression, and improved query performance through predicate pushdown."
