      "operation": "Reading data from a text file using `spark.sparkContext.textFile()` (line 7)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Reading data from a text file line by line is inefficient. Using a serialized format like Parquet or ORC would allow Spark to read the data in a more efficient manner, reducing processing time and improving performance.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read data from Parquet file\nparquet_df = spark.read.parquet(\"path/to/employees.parquet\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to Parquet or ORC would provide the following benefits:\n* **Faster reads/writes:** Serialized formats are optimized for reading and writing data, resulting in faster processing times.\n* **Compression:** Parquet and ORC support compression, which can significantly reduce storage space requirements.\n* **Query optimization:** Spark can perform predicate pushdown with Parquet and ORC, allowing it to filter data before reading it, further improving query performance."
