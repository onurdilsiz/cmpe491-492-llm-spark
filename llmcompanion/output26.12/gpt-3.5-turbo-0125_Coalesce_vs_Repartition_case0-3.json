            "operation": "inputRDD = inputRDD.repartition(3)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(3) operation is used to increase the number of partitions to 3. However, in this context, reducing the partitions using coalesce() can be more efficient as it avoids a full shuffle when decreasing the number of partitions.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "inputRDD = inputRDD.coalesce(3)",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce(3) from repartition(3) will reduce shuffling overhead, improve resource utilization, and potentially lead to faster job execution."
