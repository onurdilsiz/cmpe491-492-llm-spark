      "operation": "Reading data from a text file using RDD (line 6)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Reading data from a text file using RDD is inefficient. It is recommended to use DataFrame/Dataset API for structured data processing. Additionally, reading data from a serialized format like Parquet or ORC would further improve performance due to faster reads and compression.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Read data from Parquet file\ntransactions_df = spark.read.parquet(\"path/to/transactions.parquet\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Faster reads, compression, and query optimization through predicate pushdown."

      "operation": "Saving data in CSV format (line 21)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Saving data in CSV format is not optimized for Spark. It is recommended to use a serialized format like Parquet or ORC for faster writes and compression.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Save data in Parquet format\nrepartitioned_df.write.parquet(\"path/to/electronics_transactions_output.parquet\")\n```",

      "operation": "Using repartition() instead of coalesce() (line 17)",
      "improvementExplanation": "Using repartition() instead of coalesce() can cause unnecessary shuffles and performance degradation. Coalesce() should be used when reducing the number of partitions, while repartition() should be used when changing the number of partitions.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\n# Coalesce to reduce the number of partitions\ncoalesced_df = repartitioned_df.coalesce(5)\n```",
      "benefits": "Reduced shuffles and improved performance."
