            "operation": "rdd2=df.rdd.map(lambda x: (x,1)).repartition(4)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(4) operation is used to increase the number of partitions to 4. However, in this context, reducing the number of partitions using coalesce() can be more efficient as it avoids a full shuffle.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "rdd2=df.rdd.map(lambda x: (x,1)).coalesce(2)",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce(2) reduces shuffling overhead, optimizes resource usage, and potentially speeds up the job execution."
