            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition() operation is used to increase the number of partitions when converting an RDD to a DataFrame. However, in this case, the operation does not require a full shuffle as the data is already filtered and partitioned correctly. Using coalesce() instead of repartition() can avoid unnecessary shuffling.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "customer_df = adult_customers_rdd.toDF([\"customer_id\", \"name\", \"age\", \"city\"]).coalesce(adult_customers_rdd.getNumPartitions())",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() can reduce unnecessary shuffling, improve resource usage by avoiding full data movement, and potentially lead to faster job runtime."
