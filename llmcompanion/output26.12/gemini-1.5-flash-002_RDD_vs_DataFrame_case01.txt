      "dataframeEquivalent": "sales_df = spark.read.csv(\"path/to/sales.txt\", header=False, inferSchema=True)\n#InferSchema infers the schema automatically from the data. If you know the schema beforehand, you can specify it explicitly for better performance.",

      "improvementExplanation": "Using repartition() unnecessarily increases the number of partitions, leading to significant data shuffling.  coalesce() should be used when reducing the number of partitions to minimize shuffling.",
      "dataframeEquivalent": "If reducing partitions is needed, use coalesce instead of repartition: \nrepartitioned_df = electronics_sales_df.coalesce(10)",
      "benefits": "Using coalesce() instead of repartition() when reducing the number of partitions minimizes data shuffling, improving performance and resource utilization.  Repartitioning should only be used when increasing the number of partitions, and only when absolutely necessary."
