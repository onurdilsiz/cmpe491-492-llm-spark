        {
            "operation": "repartition(10)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(10) operation is inefficient as it forces a full shuffle to create 10 partitions, which may be unnecessary and resource-intensive. Coalesce() can be used to reduce the number of partitions without performing a full shuffle.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "coalesced_df = df.coalesce(5)",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce() will reduce unnecessary shuffling, optimize resource usage, and potentially lead to faster job execution."
