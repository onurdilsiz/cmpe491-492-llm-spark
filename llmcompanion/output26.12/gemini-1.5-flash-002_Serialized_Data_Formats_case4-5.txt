      "operation": "write_to_parquet function (lines 40-44): Writes pandas DataFrame to parquet files.  \npyspark_processing function (line 166): spark.read.parquet(dir_path) reads parquet files into a Spark DataFrame.",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code uses pandas to write to parquet, which is inefficient for large datasets.  Spark's built-in parquet writer is significantly faster and leverages its distributed processing capabilities. Reading parquet files directly with Spark also avoids the overhead of converting between pandas and Spark DataFrames.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\ndef write_to_parquet(data, dir_path, chunk):\n    parquet_path = dir_path + 'page_data_chunk_' + str(chunk) + '.parquet'\n    spark = SparkSession.builder.appName('parquet_writer').getOrCreate()\n    columns = ['idx', 'chunk', 'page_id', 'page_name', 'page_bytearray']\n    spark_df = spark.createDataFrame(data, columns)\n    spark_df.write.parquet(parquet_path)\n    spark.stop()\n\n#In pyspark_processing function replace:\n#df = spark.read.parquet(dir_path)\nwith:\n#spark = SparkSession.builder.appName('trec_car_spark').getOrCreate()\ndf = spark.read.parquet(dir_path)\n#spark.stop() #Consider stopping the session if not needed elsewhere\n```",
      "benefits": "Faster writes due to Spark's distributed processing.  Faster reads due to optimized Parquet format and Spark's optimized reader. Reduced memory usage by avoiding pandas intermediary. Predicate pushdown and other query optimizations are possible with Spark's Parquet support."
    },
    {
      "operation": "write_pages_data_to_dir function (lines 40-44): Uses pandas to write data to parquet files.",
      "improvementExplanation": "Writing data in chunks using pandas `to_parquet` is inefficient.  Spark's built-in `write.parquet` is much faster and leverages its distributed capabilities.  This change eliminates the need for intermediate pandas DataFrames, reducing memory usage and improving performance.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\ndef write_pages_data_to_dir(read_path, dir_path, num_pages=1, chunks=100000, print_intervals=100, write_output=False):\n    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)\n    spark = SparkSession.builder.appName('parquet_writer').getOrCreate()\n    columns = ['idx', 'chunk', 'page_id', 'page_name', 'page_bytearray']\n    spark_df = spark.createDataFrame(pages_data, columns)\n    spark_df.write.parquet(parquet_path)\n    spark.stop()\n```",

    {
      "operation": "write_to_protobuf function (lines 212-228): Writes data to a protobuf binary file.",
      "improvementExplanation": "Writing data row by row to a binary file is inefficient.  Using a columnar format like Parquet or ORC would significantly improve read performance and enable efficient query processing.  Parquet or ORC offer better compression and support for predicate pushdown.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\ndef write_to_parquet_from_df(df, path):\n    df.write.parquet(path)\n```",
      "benefits": "Faster writes with better compression.  Significantly faster reads, especially for partial data access.  Enables efficient query processing with predicate pushdown and other optimizations."
    },
    {
      "operation": "read_from_protobuf function (lines 198-202): Reads data from a protobuf binary file.",
      "improvementExplanation": "Reading the entire protobuf file into memory at once is inefficient, especially for large files.  Using a columnar format like Parquet or ORC allows for reading only the necessary columns and rows, improving performance and reducing memory usage.  Parquet and ORC also offer better compression.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "```python\ndef read_from_parquet(path):\n    spark = SparkSession.builder.appName('parquet_reader').getOrCreate()\n    df = spark.read.parquet(path)\n    # Process the DataFrame\n    spark.stop()\n```",
