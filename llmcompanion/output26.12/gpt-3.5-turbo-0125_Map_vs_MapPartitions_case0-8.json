            "improvementExplanation": "The map() transformation is used implicitly within the reduceByKey operation to transform the data before the reduce step. In this case, the map() operation can be replaced with mapPartitions() to improve efficiency by processing data at the partition level.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "rdd2 = rdd.mapPartitions(lambda iter: [(word, 1) for word in iter]).reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a + b)",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() allows processing multiple elements within a partition at once, reducing function call overhead and potentially improving performance, especially for I/O-heavy operations or when the transformation logic can be applied at the partition level."
