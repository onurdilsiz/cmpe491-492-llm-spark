        {
            "operation": "df.repartition(5)",
            "improvementExplanation": "The repartition(5) operation is used to increase the number of partitions to 5, which may lead to unnecessary shuffling of data across the cluster. Since the goal is to reduce the number of partitions without full shuffling, coalesce() can be used instead.",
            "coalesceEquivalent": "df.coalesce(3)",
            "benefits": "Switching to coalesce(3) reduces unnecessary shuffling, optimizes resource usage, and potentially speeds up the job runtime."
