            "improvementExplanation": "The map() transformation is used to apply a set of column-wise operations to the DataFrame. Since these operations can be performed independently on each partition without the need to access other partitions, using mapPartitions() can improve efficiency by reducing function call overhead and optimizing the processing at the partition level.",
            "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "df = df.rdd.mapPartitions(lambda iterator: ([row.withColumns({...}) for row in iterator])).toDF()",
            "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() can lead to improved performance by processing data at the partition level, reducing overhead associated with function calls, and optimizing I/O operations within each partition."
