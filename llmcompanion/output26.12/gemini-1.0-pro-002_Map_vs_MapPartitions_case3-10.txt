      "operation": "The map() operation is used on line 54 to transform the input values from the string indexer.",
      "improvementExplanation": "In this case, the map() operation is applied to each row of the DataFrame individually. However, the transformation being performed (converting string values to numerical indices) can be efficiently done at the partition level using mapPartitions(). This would reduce the number of function calls and improve I/O performance.",
      "mapPartitionsEquivalent": "```python\n# Transforming the input values from the string indexer\npred_row = pred_row.rdd.mapPartitions(lambda partition: indexer.transform(partition))\n```",
      "benefits": "Switching to mapPartitions() in this case would provide the following benefits:\n- Reduced function call overhead: By processing data in partitions, we avoid calling the indexer function for each individual row.\n- Optimized I/O: Reading and writing data in larger chunks can improve I/O efficiency.\n- Improved resource utilization: Processing data in parallel across partitions can utilize multiple cores and improve overall performance."
