      "operation": "Reading text data from HDFS in CSV format (line 10):\n`df1 = spark.read.text(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/csv-file\")`",
      "improvementExplanation": "The code reads data from a CSV file stored in HDFS using the `spark.read.text` method.  This method treats the data as plain text, requiring significant parsing to extract structured information.  Switching to Parquet or ORC would eliminate this parsing overhead. Parquet and ORC are columnar storage formats that store data in a more efficient way for analytical queries. They also support compression and schema enforcement, leading to faster read times and reduced storage space.",
      "optimizedEquivalent": "Assuming the CSV file has a header row and the data is consistently formatted, we can directly read it as a Parquet file if it's already converted. If not, we first need to convert the CSV to Parquet:\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import * \n\ndf1 = spark.read.csv(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/csv-file\", header=True, inferSchema=True)\ndf1.write.parquet(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/parquet-file\")\n\n#Then read the parquet file\ndf1 = spark.read.parquet(\"hdfs://namenode/output/itmd-521/drp/2000/parquet-file\")\n```",
      "benefits": "Faster read speeds, reduced storage space due to compression, schema enforcement, and potential for predicate pushdown optimization."

      "improvementExplanation": "The code writes the processed DataFrame to HDFS as a CSV file with LZ4 compression. While LZ4 provides some compression, Parquet or ORC offer significantly better compression ratios and faster write speeds, especially for large datasets.  Parquet and ORC's columnar storage also allows for efficient processing of specific columns, improving query performance.",

      "benefits": "Faster write speeds, significantly better compression leading to reduced storage costs, and improved query performance due to columnar storage and efficient data access."
